Review_Text,Sentiment
Its really nice place to stay especially for business and tourist purpose.,3
"It seems that hotel does not check the basic amenities in the room, before handing over the room to the traveller. The phone in my room was not working and it created a problem for me, as after a hectic day of travel you would like to relax and work at your own pace. So they sent the technician who kept on looking for the fix for about an hour and then i had to get my room changed.",1
Worst hotel I have ever encountered. I will never think to stay in thiis hotel in the future,1
"Had a good time in this hotel and the staff Kumar,aishwarya, and the house keeping guy not sure what his name these people make my stay pleasant and happy for 5 days. For sure I will be back to this place to stay in chennai.Good job guys",3
good hotel and staff Veg food good non veg breakfast needs improvement,3
Great hotel. The staff if welcoming. Helpful. Always there for you.,3
"The hotel is mostly clean, but bathrooms need some care, our first bathroom had no hot water, the second one, took a very long time to drain off the tub. Plus painting and caulking were peeling off the wall.
On the plus point, great restaurants and excellent customer service.",3
"Awesome hotel with all needed amenities and luxury, friendly staff, great food",3
"Very nice 
Comfortable",3
The staff of the hotel were polite. The brick oven chefs were extremely helpful and all the meals were very good. The room was as advertised and clean. My stay of 2 days was very comfortable and I would recommend this hotel to others.,3
"Overall a pleasant stay.
Veg restaurant was the best experience @ decent price.",3
"I was on my business trip & my stay was for two days, I found perfect hotel with excellent cleanliness and location is also perfect, nice. In all, it is value for money hotel. Suggest to offer at least breakfast included in that offer in case of single occupancy. For double occupancy it is a great deal.",3
"Location : In T Nagar. Very close to the shopping hub and also a few cult South Indian restaurants like Saravana and Murugan. Room : Spacious, Well-lit and clean rooms. Staff : Courteous staff with a simple 2 mins check-in process.",3
Very good stay. Nice location. Suggest to offer breakfast included in that offer. Also check to offer for complimentary pick up and drop to airport. These things add value to offer and certainly increased business. All the best. Will certainly recommend to stay at this hotel.,3
Its value for money. Its a pleasant experience. They have to improve the reception. Otherwise nothing bad about the hotel. Breakfast is super and the staff are very courteous. I like to stay again. We enjoyed this pleasant stay.,3
"Cannot think of any negative for this hotel. Right from check in to check out, it was all smooth and an experience to remember. One for one offer for residents at Zodiac made it better. Located in the heart of the shopping district and easily accessible by all modes. Some of the staff had difficulty understanding English, rest all was good.",3
Table and chair not clean. Not value for money. PC lan cable has so much dust but WiFi Internet speed is too good. Bar service is too bad only one waiter serving to all customer. Serving food like tandoori chicken is very salty.,2
Good experience and good hotel to stay. I recommend my friend to stay at accord. Location is good and the service was also good. I have rated 5 star for this hotel. Continue the same service you will be the topper.,3
The overall experience of the hotel was good. I had visited this hotel with my family. The appearance of the hotel was good. The check in and checkout was on time in the hotel. The service was good in the hotel. The room was spacious and clean. All the amenities were provided in the room. The food was good in the hotel. The complimentary breakfast was provided in the hotel.,3
I am taking this hotel as 4 stars since the rooms are so small and we can't place our luggages in a suitable place. Japanese restaurant was not good. Food are so small quantity. Not worth the money.,3
Neat and clean good service very good location good service by house keeping etc,3
The Hotel is centrally located in T Nagar area and also it is a luxury hotel with good rooms and staff is very courteous too. The food at the restaurant is the best thing about this hotel as they have a lot of options to eat. The food taste and quality is very good.,3
"You could stay there, it's a nice place. The hotel is good, the location is good, food is excellent. Well built and cleanliness level is above 100. Overall, it was a good experience, you'll find it worth the money spent. Thanks!",3
I had visited this hotel for official purpose. All facility was provided in the room. Everything was fine at the hotel.,3
"Nice Hotel with good amenities. Nice Room with facilities, good Service and decent Breakfast spread, Value for Money! Situated at the prime place, easy connectivity and easy to locate. Good for families, groups and Business purpose. It was a comfortable stay!",3
This is a very good hotel in the heart of the city and offers good value for money. I book this most of the times when I travel to Chennai. The staff is very courteous and they do everything to make your stay awesome. The restaurant options are also many and you are spoilt for choice. There is also a lounge on the terrace which offers a great view of the city,3
We had a pleasant stay there. The staff were very friendly. Don't rent a cab from them as they charge lot more than other regular service providers.,3
"The service is good ,the also provide free Wi-Fi internet connection ,the breakfast is ok but need to do some improvement .",3
"Close to shopping, nice restaurants, good breakfast.",3
Excellent staff.very friendly&helpful.however timetaken to resond was poor.breakfast menu could be better.daily toiletry &towel replenishment insufficient.but overal stay was pleasant.,3
"Facilities: Nice ; Value: Fantastic; Service: Professional; Cleanliness: Pleasant; 
There's three restaurant inside this hotel so there is plenty of variety",3
Perhaps they were making most of Chennai being almost Sold-out during my stay duration but asking for 5k without even basic facilities like complementary bottled water... Wow!!,2
"stayed with my wife in January, 2016. Very happy experience.",3
"Front Office staff welcoming and helpful at every turn. Overall a comfortable stay. Rooms are small, but more than adequate for a single person.",3
Nice and comfortable and ideal for my activities,3
"The physical facilities are quite nice - large clean room, comfortable lobby - but little things detract. The safe malfunctioned the day before I left, the WiFi bandwidth was overly maxed out during evenings making email impossible, the fitness room was a joke.",2
The location was perfect.,3
Good,3
"Check in took more then 45 mins, all the 4 pillows in the room where of different sizes, dirty and stained curtains, no phone next to bed and you have to walk to the study table, slow room service, poor understanding of how international bookings work, do not accept discover cards,",1
Room was very clean and well maintained.. breakfast was extraordinary..,3
"My stay in The Park was a very pleasant one. The front desk staffs were very friendly,helpful and warm. They arranged even a cradle for my 2 month old baby. The room was well maintained and the complimentary breakfast had a wide spread. Overall the experience was a pleasant one.",3
"This property is a bit old. Bath tub, toilets are old and had stains. White towels were provided, but even they had stains and dirty.",1
"The hotel rooms are quite old and are not maintained. The chair cushion was torn. Shower curtains, window curtains and even the phone had a musty smell. Wait at the reception was too long. 
Breakfast was decent. Location is very good for US visa applicants.",1
Wifi needs to improve,3
This place is probably better for business travelers but its definitely cramped for families. The bathrooms were very small and i felt I like was in a plane toilet. The location is outstanding though and accessible to almost everything in mainland chennai.,2
They have a good lobby and good place to eat. Everything else comes no way near the 5 star hotel that they claim to be. Rooms are just about 3 star hotel level. Was just disappointed. thankfully had booked here only for a day.,1
"Need to improve cleanness

Need to improve customer careness

Employee at resturent are should care enough all the customers",2
Need maintaince there was smell in the room. Breakfast was good.,2
As soon as we entered the room our first thought was not to touch anything as it was very dirty. room was worse then a cheap motel room and you wouldn't want to get close to the bed. This is definitely not a 5* hotel as mentioned on Expedia. Its close to US consulate but with rooms so bad I would rather travel a few minutes then stay here.,1
"The hotel is well located in central chennai. Its easy to find places to go out in the evneing after work, or for shopping at the two big malls nearby. They have a nice pool on the 8th floor and several bars in the hotel.",3
Nobody attends phone. Rooms are very old & small. Very small outdated tv,1
"While the location, room, facilities are good. There is lot to be improved on service levels especially at the time of check-in and checkout. The staff at the reception counter possibly are not trained well or there is too much of attrition of trained staff. Wait for checkin/checkout is too long and not acceptable from a star category hotel.",3
Great location. But this hotel is not worth the price they charge. Terrible room layouts. Staff is slow and not trained properly. Guest services will not pick up phone. Had to call 4-5 times before they pick up. Spent lot of time to handle requests put on reservation at time of booking.,1
The hotel night club DJ is good and good place for party goers yyy66,3
Cleanliness at restroom and corridors and pathways could have been better. There is no hot water in the morning time before 8am. Hot water problem was there on both the days of stay. Couple of lights were not working.,3
"Room was spacious. Maintenance is bad with cracked walls, water seepage. The hotel management needs to spruce it up. Not value for money. Location is great though. Very centrally located and in the heart of the city.",3
"If they can accommodate the check-in with your arrival time it will be good. We had to wait for 3hours after reaching the hotel to get the room, though it was booked 1month in advance. Location is very good. Hotel staff are very helpful.",3
This hotel was at perfect location near US consulate. Hotel was very beautiful and well maintained. Was filled with mostly people who have came for visa interview. Staff also was very helpful and cooperative.,3
"Pros: Centrally located - close to the us embassy, food at hotel 601 was good, friendly staff, decent gym and swimming pool. Cons: Poor rooms/worn out floors, over prized, long waits for checking out.",2
Enjoyed my stay. Very pleasant service. My stay included buffet breakfast which was excellent. The location is very close to the US consulate which is a big advantage. There are lots of eating options within a few miles radius. Will recommend luxury rooms.,3

"I made a booking for my guests, my guests were not allowed to stay in spite of a booking and payment being made online, my guests were made to wait at the lobby nearly 5 hours. Finally, I gave my ID proofs to accommodate them and yet it was not accepted and had to find a alternate solution in other hotel. Not a customer friendly hotel.",2
"It was very nice to stay in the park hotel with all the well equipped and its clean, I am happy to stay in future.. Its in right location for us to stay and hotel reception staff and service team are very polite and professional, I have not used much facilities which are available but next time I will try to use more.",3
"The rooms renovated are also leaking, Water seepage is there in the walls. Very bad maintenance. This hotel is good for pubbing only. Mattress very soft and you get back pain. High time they replace the mattress.. Renovation is a must at this stage. Always hot water problem is there and taps are leaky. Health faucet must in the toilets.",3
"Overall a good place to stay. Food was good. Rooms were clean and have enough space. Best place for visa interview as the place is right opposite and in case you forgot something for visa, you can get it quickly from room.",3
"Except for being in the heart of city the hotel has nothing to boast of. Food tasted awful so much so, that we almost ate with pickle as a side dish. Breakfast room is poorly lit is enough to make your morning dull. Rooms unkempt and falling apart.",1
"Hotel rooms are to be repaired in the bathrooms. As walls are to repainted. Outside windows are not clean, birds made dirty on that. But inside rooms are clean and well maintained AC Services are good.",3
"Bathroom dirty , room dirty bedsheets not changed only positive thing is the buffet breakfast",1
Hotel staff are not co-ordinating well for the room service and Billing payment.,1
I am not sure why someone wants to spend that kind of money to be disappointed.,1
"This is an ideal hotel to stay in - clean, friendly, good wholesome food and excellent value for money for a discerning customer. The staff are pleasant and helpful in all areas - reception, dining, housekeeping and concierge services. Try it and return again.",3
Good,3
Dinner buffet was not too pricey and food was amazing! The only downside during my stay was the discoloration of water in the bathroom sink.,2
"Great service, clean room and nice ambiance. I stayed with my family and we had a good time. I would recommend not just for business stays but also for families.",3
"Great staff, Good location, good food. Cleanliness need to get improved, every thing else is good",3
"Excellent experience, clean room, friendly and courteous staff. Good restaurants in the hotel, nice food.",3
Very helpful staff and you are really taken care about things that you need.,3
"Room service poor. Service took time. Also the tray was not cleared.
Dissapointed with that.
Location of hotel is good.
Buffet dinner and breakfast was good.
Nothing more to say other than this. 
Nothing more to say other than this. 
Nothing more to say other than this. 
Nothing more to say other than this.",3
"It was great. Food is expensive, but good. Taxes are high. And the hotel car to the airport was $25.00 plus taxes; that was expensive; I could probably gotten my own taxis for $10.00-15.00. 
Great place and excellent service.",3
Excellent hotel with great staff. Would greatly recommend.,3
"Hotel room is great, and the staff are very helpful. Located on Anna Salai, So forget taking a walk to get to nearby places. Add ons like lunch/dinner buffet costs too much- but this is expected. One thing I did not like is the presence of too many staffs and the 'vanakkam' they perform at the front door-I did not need that every time I come in- just a smile would have been enough. But the hotel as such no complaints.",3
This was my second visit. Enjoyed our stay very much. Will definitely stay at The Raintree when I am Chennai next.,3
The hotel location is good... but the beds are very bad and old. The shower room was not all clean.,2
Very good experience. All very attentive staff and very good location,3
"Facilities: Top of the line; Value: Fantastic; Service: Outstanding; Cleanliness: Immaculate; 
the perfect base for any visitor to Chennai - I'll be back",3
The service could improve. A lot of time taken for room service.,3
"While we appreciate the staff & service, the bathroom taps, dustbins, cleaning of WC, ventilation in the room (windows are permanently closed) need your attention. Please check and make it right. We really had to adjust.",2
Good service and fairly comfortable stay,3
"Rooms need a make over.
kettle is old & not in good condition.
Not upto Lemon Tree standard",2
"Good hotel and room. Not too far from the airport - about 15 mins. Helpful staff, restaurant maybe overpriced but not bad. Bed was comfortable and clean. Free WiFi wasn't really good. Overall quite satisfied.",3
dated - router is outside in the front - rooms in the back has poor to no internet - food is sub standard - age and heavy usage is taking toll - needs major renovation to keep up with US chains.,1
"We asked for a non smoking room but we did not get one and the AC was not working.. otherwise good location, clean beds and towels ...",2
Excellent in terms of hygienic and cleanliness. Enjoyed stay. However food prices are comparatively in higher side. Co-operative staff. Best in class. Would like to stay again. Thanks to Leman Tree staff.,3
Hotel is good. But food cost is too high,3
"The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are well maintained and clean. The hotel is close by to the airport hence it is very easy accessible. Breakfast, lunch and dinner quality is just too good.",3
Good and enjoyed the stay. Good food. Neat and good room service. Location of the hotel also very good. Near airport and Railway station and IT companies. Sure I will again visit your hotel. Too good for family stay too.,3
"Compared to other lemon tree stay, this was bit disappointing compared to the room comfortability.",3
Very very very very very poor Service. Very very very very very poor Air Conditioning. Very very very very very poor Service. Very very very very very poor Conditioning.,3
The size of the bed is so small that a single person is uncomfortable to sleep. They sell the same bed on double occupancy. Difficult to imagine how two persons can fit on the bed. Washrooms are so small. One can barely move around. Breakfast truly is free. Not complimentary. Food was absolutely not having any taste. Totally waste of money and uncomfortable night.,2
"Room allotted is small. Single bed in the room. Buffet dinner spread not upto the mark. Quality of food not upto the mark. Breakfast quality need to improve more. Spread of fruits not liked. Need to improve. Moreover, cost of buffet dinner does not match with quality and spread.",3
The room size is small & not as big as you see in photos. The service was good overall. The quality of food at the Bar & restaurant was not that great & they could improve the quality of food & also even reduce the rates.,3
No doubt hotel is located in quiet prime location for business travellers but I don't think it is value for money given the room size. The staff is pleasant to deal with. Food variety is also average. They should have facilities like spa for business travellers also who wish to relax after a long day.,3
The overall experience was good in the hotel. The hotel was located near to the airport. The behaviour of the hotel staff was good in the hotel. The food and drinks were available in the hotel was very good. The activities were not available in the hotel. Wi-Fi service was available in the hotel.,3
Everything that you need was in place.. There was no need to call for any Services. Food quality is also equally good. The location is also convenient for air as well as rail. The reception staff is also very cooperative.,3
"Very clean, value for money. Prompt service. Beautiful aroma. Only problem is view, which is comprise able. The buffet dinner was asko good. We were even provided with take away breakfast at 4:30 in the morning.",3
"Cleanliness and hospitality was excellent. The complimentary breakfast was good. The only room facility which was not up to the mark was internet, too slow. I stayed as single but rooms would surely can accommodate a family. Worth for the money I paid so would surely recommend for a short stay.",3
"The first thing is, it's too costly for a small room. I am not satisfied with your time schedule for. This type of feedback format is somewhat not good for us. And I'm sorry for late reply.",3
"This is actually a 3 star hotel, and in India there are 7 stars, and so a four star rating in Expedia is very misleading. The hotel is not very clean, but for a 2-3 star hotel it is ok if that is what you are expecting, the prices were way too high for that level of quality. I moved to the Hilton, and was very satisfied.",2
Nice experience... Some people i think some workers were shouting outside my room door which was disturbing,3
"All boxes ticked for a Business Traveller. Clean Room, Clean Toilets, Decent Break Fast Spread.",3
Nice stay..very good service...especially the person named mr. dinesh who is in reception assisted me a lot.such a good person in the hotel..he assisted me till the period of vacate..very good person..,3
We really enjoyed the pool and the food as well. Well cleaned. Definitely recommend to any one,3
"Stay somewhere else, This hotel is right on the flight path to the airport, and is adjacent to the main road where lorry drivers use the horn more than the brake",2
We stayed at the Park Hyatt for a week primarily to attend a family wedding which was being held there. The hotel and the service were very first class but unfortunately the area where it is located is not good. The rooftop pool is very pleasant. Food and drink in the hotel is very expensive and the bar area which is not open until 4pm is very noisy with disco type music on at full volume. Nowhere to sit and have a quiet drink.,3
Staff have been very helpful to help me avoid Channai pitfalls and support me while lost in translation.,3
"Moved to this hotel after a terrible night at another. This hotel is amazing. The service is top notch. The decor, especially if you are in the garment industry is stunning. Food is great. Can't say enough good things.",3
Quick efficient friendly check in. Overall great hotel in Chennai. Will stay again.,3
Nothing to complain,3
was good . letting my guest with ease next time would be appreciated . was good . letting my guest with ease next time would be appreciated,3
"First time stay. Loved it. Everyone was super polite, helpful, nice.
One needs to check the final bill as there can be errors.",3
"It was a pleasant stay, Excellent experience, great ambience, very courteous staff and the hotel caters customers needs round the clock. Rooms were too good, Will ensure to stay again in future and recommend to all my friends. Keep up the good work Thank you Hyatt certainly very good value for money. Kudos!",3
Overall ambience of the hotel is very good. In room facilities need to improve & there is a need for providing services as per customer booking. 3 people in same room has been provided with 2 persons facility whereas the charges remains for 3 people.,3
Park Hyatt really lived to the hype. The best part of this hotel is the bathroom and roof top swimming pool which gives you a great view of Chennai. Their flagship pub Flying Elephants is really happening on the weekends and as a staying guess you get a free entry to one of the most exciting pubs. The service and ambience of this hotel was top notch and unparalleled.,3
My experience of the hotel was very nice. The transportation facility was not provided by the hotel. The activities were available at the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for upcoming travellers.,3
"Very good service, very clean, great food and nice gym. 15% less in price would help my pocket..",3
GOOD.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,3
"This is a very good hotel with modern looks and excellent service. Staff is quite friendly and food is good. Staff feels happy assisting you for almost anything. Everybody treats guest like they are someone special. Rooms are quite spacious, clean and equipped with all amenities which are needed.",3
I had visited this hotel with my family. The food quality was good. The service at the hotel was nice. The check in and checkout was on time. The complimentary food was provided at the hotel. The restaurant was available at the hotel. The varieties of food were provided at the hotel. I don’t have any suggestion for this hotel. I would recommend this hotel for other travellers.,3
nice place good staff i can feel the quality of money food is also good but little far from city i feel house keeping also good,3
"As soon as I checked-in, I found pungent smell in the room. Even after informing customer service desk, it took them quite long time to allocate new room and that to after multiple follow ups. Moreover, the food served at room was not good. It looked that it was not prepared by chef.",2
"Great ambience, good staff, wonderful food, big rooms. Accessibility to Airport, nice location and all at reasonable price. Mine was a short but comfortable stay. Overall, 5 star stay. Recommended for future stay in Chennai.",3
We stayed between Xmas and New Year 2015 for 3 nights in this wonderful hotel.The location is absolutely brilliant being only 300 yards from the town Square. We were lucky to get a 'free' room up grade to one of the superb loft conversion - two level room with the four poster beds -Nice ! . All the staff were very helpful. The breakfasts were good,3
It was a bright Sunday and myself with my family decided to check-in Park Hyatt in Guindy and as we expected it was the experience to cherish. It gave the absolute delight of being in the star hotel and the food quality was splendid. The service was also upto the mark of a five star hotel. Summing up all it made it crisp experience on Sunday morning.,3
There is no business centre. One doesn't expect a hotel of 4.5 star not to have a business centre.,3
Excellent value for quality and service. Can't go wrong. Breakfast is top notch with Indian and continental options. Decor is subdued but stylish. Good for business or pleasure. Gym has modern equipment with an infinity pool. No problem with free wifi. Better deal than Leela Palace. Family was very happy and thought the hotel was on target.,3
"Excellent room and exercise facility. All around atmosphere was calm and comfortable. Main dining room offers both excellent food and service. Avoid Flying Elephant restaurant, stick to the main dining room.",3
comfortable. not needed.bkhkhjuoipoioioi hkhghkhkhkjh ghjggjhghggg,3
The outside look and feel very good. They have a reasonably good restaurant,2
"Very clean!
Great Service!",3
Very nice hotel. Good location. However the sad part is that the 24 hours check in/ check out policy is not applicable for booking made on hotels.com . They said it is only valid when you book directly with the hotel.,3
The majority of staff at the reception and in the dinning hall were excellent and welcoming.,3
good,3
I saw a much better upkeep of the facility two years back,2
"There was no confirmation of my booking as per their record.
I had to wait for 30 minutes",2
"The room is clean, international standards, option of turning on ceiling lights if you prefer brighter otherwise is warm and cosy.

Toilet small but funtional and water pressure good (16th floor room).",3
We had great experience in staying here. Check in and check out process was smooth and easy. Decent food options were available at the hotel. Staff were responsive and quick for any requests. Roof top restaurant and view of the city is one not to be missed.,3
Reception on arrival and at the restaurant is Excellent. Check-in and Check-out formalities were handled efficiently. Room is big in size. Ambience is excellent. Food quality at restaurant is good. Service representatives in restaurant took care so nicely - my special appreciation to them. The location of the hotel and the surrounding ambience are pleasant.,3
Decent hotel but buffet was not up to expectation. You can have better lunch or breakfast for that money,3
Really enjoyed the buffet food with it's wide variety,3
EXCELLENT***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************,3
It was a good experience. We had a very wonderful time there. The service was excellent. They provide the best service. Thank you for such a wonderful experience. Keep up the good work and maintain the hotel as it is.,3
"24 hrs check-in is the best part about this hotel. Service is great, Staff is helpful and friendly, food is good and excellent location. I always enjoy my stay here. However the Gym should be improved. More space is needed and equipment requires major upgrade.",3
Good hotel and nice location. Staff is very supportive and took great care. The pub is nice and ambience is awesome. I would strongly suggest this hotel for any business traveller. It is situated in the heart of city and in main market area.,3
"Great location, very close to city center and markets. Staff is very helpful and service is great. We had some special requests and they helped us with all of them. Enjoyed our stay. Would recommend to others.",3
I will definitely stay this hotel on my next visit to Chennai. Very good ambience. Shopping centres nearby. Facilities are excellent Staff is also good and supportive,3
It has extremely great ambience and the rooms are good. Liked the experience. The buffet was costly however the food is good. The swimming pool was great and the gym facility was good. I enjoyed playing in the pool and the cleanliness of the pool was appreciable. Overall rating : 4. 5/5.,3
Nice hotel with very good ambience. Nice reception and overall design. All locations are designed to feel good and spacious. People are very soft and gentle and skilled to serve all kind of guest including foreigners.,3
The hotel reception staff are very bad. Even the other services in the hotel is same only. I ordered fish fry but got very bad smelling really totally damaged one. Breakfast is also not up to the mark.,1
Very homely and safe environment. Breakfast excellent. The check in and check out was very simple. We called and asked for a late check-in and check out which was honoured. The hotel is centrally located in the heart of the shopping centre. The hotel was very safe as we were traveling single.,3
"Centrally located. Great food and rooms. Reasonably priced. Hotel has one of the very good pub, though the food quality was OK. Little disappointed with food at ""Southern Aroma"", my most favourite restaurant. Overall experience was great.",3
Complimentary breakfast was given by the hotel. The hotel was good. There was no delay in check in and checkout at the hotel. I was satisfied with this hotel stay. I didn’t use activity in the hotel.,2
Friendly and helpful staff. Nice food. Clean rooms. Really enjoyed our stay. We stayed at this hotel 3 times before. We go again.,3
"Excellent hotel. Great value for money. Great staff. I stayed for 2 nights, and hence was initially offered complimentary breakfast for 2 days only. I checked out the third day, after breakfast hours. Hence they were gracious enough to offer free breakfast for my family of 3 (which runs about US$ 25) for free.",3
Pictures are the service does not match ..,1
nice stay for my first night after arrival to India,2
"The place is neat, rooms are adequate with all amenities, bedsheets are clean. Wifi connection is good. The place is walkable distance from T. Nagar which is a shopping area. Buffet breakfast at a restaurant downstairs is really good and serve wide variety. Staff is friendly and helpful, they assisted us whenever we needed. Overall happy with the stay!",3
"A nice comfortable stay in heart of the city ,which also very affordable compared to others nearby",3
I was stayed for official purpose ..It was located in the main city and very easy to locate and room appearence needs to improve . The Room has more sapce and is good to be there. Cleanliness was maintained .. Overall experience in service needs to improve.....,3
I have stayed there on a business visit. The first thing is the location of the apartments. It is in the heart of the city. (T. Nagar). Very easy booking procedure. Only thing about the morning complimentary breakfast quality is not enough. They can improve it. Overall very nice to stay.,3
"It was good staying there, the welcoming was good, maintenance was comfortable, breakfast can be added on with any hot drinks with it. People were good, cleanliness was maintained, service for any calls was good to fill up water bottles. Can have some more comfortable zones like games, added environment to like the place more. Just not to the see it as room alone, if it would be a more comfortable, the stay would be really memorable.",2
"Good hotel, I visited for official purpose. Service is average and room size that I got is small and very congested, may be other rooms are big as I am not sure. But economically the hotel is good which you stay with your family with less average charges. Food is below average which you will get only complimentary breakfast which is too bad. Otherwise hotel is good.",2
"I have stayed 2 days on 30th and 31st March 2014 for Nestle company meeting. Service was good and the 3 rooms attached with a big hall that was not seen in any hotel really different. If a family stay they will feel like home. Need to improve in food quality and quantity, overall experience was very good.",3
"The hotel is located at a very strategic place from where all the things are very nearby and one would not face any challenge. Its not a very big hotel, however the staff is cooperative and we had to manage the food from outside mostly. Overall it was a very good location with average experience.",2
"Business trip for two days, very nice hotel, location is good, close to us consulate, close to market place, Railway Station and Airport. Neat and clean, nice food, nice restaurant. Friendly staff with quality service. Enjoyed the stay.",3
"Blossom serviced apartment are a fully furnished apartment in Chennai that serves with excellent amenities and great customer care. This serviced apartment are a boon and more economically viable alternative to a hotel rooms. it has more space , convenience factor and great privacy level especially for family members and children .",1
"Location is very good near T.Nagar, the best market area. We passed leisure time to stroll the market. Breakfast was free in the restaurant in the ground floor. The persons in the reception were well behaved and sober.",3
The hotel was the best I had stayed in in India so far but a few issues annoyed me. The control panel for certain items in the room as in the air conditioner and the hot water heater so I had a few cold showers and a hot night.,3
"Feeling very good and nice place, if we travel next time we want to book same the hotel. Hotel staff is very nice, they are co operative",3

The hotel is decent and good enough for 1 or 2 nights with family or friends. > Overall Simply Good. The MD is good and the staff is also good. > Location is a bit crowd and narrow roads. Cannot park vehicle outside the gate entrance. Should park vehicle inside and there is parking place also. > Near to Malls and restaurants.,3

"I arrived late at night from Thailand looking forward to a drink at the bar only to be told that it is a Muslim hotel and alcohol is strictly forbidden. Other than that disappointment it was very clean good staff and good value. Probably a hotel that not too many westerners stay at, but good location.",3
Never came across any issues in this hotel. simply best...,3
"We stayed there for 2 days and I have to say, I am impressed. The locality was not so good, but the rooms were pretty neat, I have to admit. The hotel provides Wi-Fi facility for its customers to be connected at all times. Their reception of customers was really great and they even gave us rebate of 700/- INR. It's pretty close to the airport, so it’s a good choice for anyone.",3
Hotel is in the mid of city & located near by Marina beach but very conjuncted space in front of hotel. Food is not so good for North Indian people staff is good & room service is ok hotel is good for middle class people only no space for parking.,2
"We stayed there for US Visa appointments and it was the best choice I think we made. Apart from the shabby ways, everything else was perfect. It is little inside, close to US consulate offices and marina beach. Hotel staffs were too good and helping. Overall, four out of five.",3
"nice and clean, and though the neighbourhood seems somewhat dodgy, it's near to the beach and the main streets (with the awesome ananda bhawan restaurant just a few mins' walk away).",3

"Ok, not bad.",2

Very old furniture with old ihome system which is not compatible with the current iPhones and iPad. I expected more out of Radisson ..was not my best experience.",2
Main benefits of this hotel is proximity to the airport given the extremely heavy traffic in the mornings. Otherwise the hotel is not up to Radisson standards and the rooms are small and cluttered.,2
It felt like 4 ⭐️ Shabby. Very convenient to the airport.,2
"The hotel was kind enough to decorate the room for our night from wedding, the rooms looked great..",3
extremely good breakfast & lunch buffets with very helpful staff,3
Rooms were of a very high standard and although we arrived about 9.30 our room was ready for us. Staff were very helpful.,3

Excellent experience starting from the pickup at Airport to drop at Airport. Pre allotted room with precomputed registration and handing over of keys and other information in the car itself giving excellent feel. Nice spread of menu for breakfast and dinner. Well made rooms and other services.,3
Superb hotel. Their hospitality was superb and all marks to them. The breakfast was superb. All was good. The airport pick and drop was excellent. Nothing wrong there. One touch service was excellent. The only weaker part was the room were old fashioned. They need to renovate it. Not really wrong with the room but the modern room this days are excellent. Worth the money.,3
Good neat hotel with friendly staff. Nearer to airport wit drop and pick up facility. Bit found food bit costlier. They do maintain a good quality. A perfect place to stay with family. Specially the club room with bathtub. Children shall enjoy the stay.,3

"Staff courtesy was excellent. My reservation issue was clarified immediately. I have 2 suggestions: 1. Need clothes hanging facility in the bathroom. 2. To have someone enumerate the facilities available for breakfast. It was confusing because many items were on offer, but had to be asked for.",3
"The staff were very helpfull and welcoming....

Airport pickup chauffeur service is great & Convenient!",3
"Hotel room were nice. Complimentary drink and foot massage. Staff was very good. I would recommend this hotel especially if you are taking flights. Close to airport, free transfers to airport.",3

The massage and spa staff were great, the breakfast was very enjoyable. We will definitely stay here again.",3
Stay at the hotel is good for the given price. However it was mentioned in the booking email breakfast is included for three days stay. But hotel receptionist say it was not included and ask me to check at HOTELS.COM. I did not get any reply from Hotels.Com until I vacate the room. So I paid for my breakfast at the hotel.,3
"Nothing much to write about as it was just one night to stay. Terrible breakfast , unclean plates cups etc. the first room they gave was smelling of cigarettes smoke fortunately they changed the room. AC was just about ok. Small tacky room",2
"Overall good , room are need& regular cleaning. Hotel Staff are very good",3
Good hotel location is good,3
I am giving the review as average just because I booked through MMT and got the deal at about 1150/- per day. If you are going for the hotel booking then they will charge about 2500/- etc. Which is absolutely not at all worth it. Rooms are OK if you get it at the range of 1000 to 1300.,2
Radisson Hotel Delhi,2
Pros Location-Value for business people they wnt stay at room fr long time Cons Very Old Building-Feels like the building will collapse at any time. Overall it is not well recommended but it's good for budget travellers,3
Rooms are not maintained. Old rooms. Bed and mattresses need to replace. To maintain subsequent visit of guest stayed once all above required. Space in the room is also less.,3
Nice Hotel as located in main biz Dist) which saves local conveyence with lively bar. Rooms are worth of money paid with complimentary breakfast ... Above all allows 24hr check in and out,3
Everything up to mark. I mean i had pleasant stay only thing upsets me is room service .. Very bad response .. Apart of that everything was good. Its at prime location,3
"Rooms were small, can't accommodate the a third person. Service is bad, took 45 min to put a third bed, then 35 min to get a blanket. Breakfast is bad WiFi was disappointing Paid food is really good Rooms bathrooms are clean and well maintained.",3
Service was decent. Food quality is average. Location is excellent. Rooms are also average only. Cockroaches in the bathroom and room. Very close to Marina and Chepauk stadium and connectivity to Chennai Central and other areas is very good. Worth only if you have a good deal online.,2
"Location and cleanliness is good, but as far as customer service is concerned, it is just average. Recommended for travelers to stay with reasonable rent. Since, the hotel is situated in Mount Road and it is accessible to all city areas. Food is just okay. Good for a quick stay.",2
"Ideally located average hotel, cleanliness is average, small rooms, good breakfast and situated in Mount Road accessible to all city areas. Behaviour of front office staff is good and recommended for travellers to stay with reasonable rent.",3
"Location and cleanliness is good. But as far as customer service is concerned, it is very worst. Even the manager doesn't respond well. Worst behaviour of staff. I didn't expect this kind of behaviour. It would be great if makemytrip does something about this.",2
It was nice stay for me in this hotel because the location of the hotel was near to the city only. And staffs was also do operative. But manager of this hotel was tottaly good because I did not face any problem in this hotel related to the service food or anything. For me it was value for money. And if I will come in this city so I will stay here only,3
"Location wise hotel is perfect, but maintenance is pathetic. Rooms were ok but bathroom was not hygiene. Food is fine. Better option for amount I paid. Booked it through Makemytrip at lowest fare I believe. Thanks to Makemytrip,. Totally I prefer not to go again.",2
Was good.Hotel room was alright food too good service and nice locationNothing else .... .. ........................ . .............................................................................. .......................,3

Great hospitality,3

I didn't like it here. But if you're working in Mahindra World City you don't have any choice. A little competition could probably help things. Staff is nice. Hotel is blah.,2
great for people who come to visit Mahindra Tech City. Will save you from travelling back to the city in the evening.,3
"I stayed there for one night, everything was great especially the helpful staff and breakfast, but there were visible stains noted on the bed sheet not sure if they changed the bed sheet or night.",3

"I stayed at Raintree with a few friends and while the facilities are great, the staff were rude and unaccommodating. I have two words to describe their attitude towards us - 'passive aggressive'. I was told this is a 5 star hotel. I can hardly believe that. Had a disappointing time because of the service. Facilities are great. Food is overpriced.",1
Great experience. Really good hotel with very professional and friendly staff. They are more than willing to go the extra mile to ensure a pleasant stay.,3
"Be careful with the taxes on your food order, while the food prices was as expected, I ended up paying about 25 usd for a glass of wine, supposedly house wine, because of \""heavy local taxes\"". I wish I had been informed before receiving the bill...",3
"Overall very good, quick WiFi.",3
Great hotel and breakfast buffet. Outstanding staff. Stayed with my family but probably ideal for the business traveler.,3
"Raintree is a good hotel located in heart of Chennai. Room was spacious and Nice. Breakfast was amazing with at-least 4 cuisines on the spread. A visist at night to the rooftop lounge is recommended for the views. But if you are on Business, be careful as internet is unstable and spotty. Recommended if business is not on your mind",3
"We had a very good stay. All the staff were attentive and helpful particularly my special needs for a man of 84 years old.
However the room was not adequately furnishes. Needs at least 2 chairs for husband and wife to sit and drink Tea.",3
i work all over the world and hotels are part of my life the Raintree St. Marys is absolutely wonderful the staff from top management to resteraunt staff and housekeeping are very friendly and accomadating they make you feel at home but with better service :) definitley recomend this place for business or vacation . the location is great and they have three resteraunts all with great food,3

"An oasis of comfort in a busy chaotic town. A very pleasant and restful,a place I looked forward to returning after each day's foray into the busy city.",3
Nice hotel at the heart of town.. close to everything,3
"Room was OK but not a five star like experience as the rooms look old and bulb fixtures, bed frame looks old.",3
"Valet parking: the ac control switch near driver's seat was broken hence self parking & having the car keys with the guests is recommended
Vegan food: their is no specific menu for vegan, in vegetarian 1 or 2 items are only vegan. Hence would not recommend breakfast here for vegans",2

THEN GIVEN ROOM NO 701",2
Ac is not good..bed is not that much good.. it's not worth paying. .,1
Awesome stay the food was slightly expensive but other than that I dont think this deserves 3.9. The only thing is the room size is small compared to other luxury hotels,3
Stay was comfortable and service is good & satisfactory,3
The overall experience was good. However the wi-fi was getting disconnected often. We found the food very expensive.,3
"Overall stay was good. However, the Wi-Fi was not working. We had to call them multiple times to fix it. It gets fixed for some time and then again they would stop working. This was the only thing that we didn't like about this hotel.",3

Great hotel but sometime felt too big,3
On the night of my arrival from NY I had a minor problem in my room. Mr Neeraj was extremely helpful in sorting out the issue immediately along with the engineering staff. His prompt service and extremely courteous manner cannot go unnoticed. Thank you Neeraj! God Bless!,3

You will not regret staying at this wonderful hotel!",3

Totally a privatised hotel for couples. Such a lovely stay at a seven star property. Love you all staff.",3
"I heard a lot about chola, but I found not to my expectation. Highly priced rooms, over priced food, and full of false pride staff. I think, I don't need two hundred words to describe Chola. Whatever I have written should be enough to understand hotel management.",3

Amazing time at Hilton resort is very good and food served is amazing. Swimming pool at resort room was awesome.

Q-bar on the roof is always hopping on Friday and Saturday nights and the food at the restaurant or room service will help any western travelers belly from getting delhi belly. Just wear your bug spray in the lobby from the mosquitos they are many.",3
The location of hotel is inside a colony and difficult to access without a vehicle. The breakfast provided by them is also disappointing.,2
Hotel is very good. Area is little inside from main road but easily get through there via google map... Maintenance is very good rooms are so nicely furnished. WiFi is there tv and most prob rooms are fully air conditioned. Overall good.,3
Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!,3
"Isolated place, very difficult to find the exact place, had to wait for long for food, cab taxi availability was a problem.",2
"I had stayed in this hotel for a day and I had a good warm welcome in front office. Room was very clean with wooden flooring. Centralised AC, quick response with staff food was fantastic. North Indian especially, morning breakfast was good too, I would come back.",3
"Though a business trip, it was good stay but I do hope it improves in due course of time. Since being single I might not have enjoyed the amenities but I do hope to visit next time with a friend or my family. I thank them for providing room service and good housekeeping services.",3
"I had great stay in this hotel, this is the first place I felt people are keen and happy to serve you, with smile on their face was so genuine. They have created a good impression about the hotel the moment I landed in Chennai, and they lived up to it throughout my stay.",3
"Average, since the destination is a business oriented one, hence has not much to offer for other target groups.",2
It was my lifes best place which i have ever visited,3
"I like food, pool, staff, gym and location and a big reason for me to choose savera. Only I they could improve their internet, they would get 5 stars.",3
Not very pleasing. Hotel reception staff attitude needs improvment,2
This place is infested with roaches. The towels provided very old though clean. The place charges more due to its proximity with US consulate. Food is expensive. This is an average hotel but expensive for the rates,2
"I had a pleasant stay with my family at this hotel, the lobby, the reception, and the swimming pool is very beautiful.",3
Not very good hotel ple do not take this hotel,1
We had a very nice stay at Savera,3
Not worth it for the money we paid..!,2
"The Savera Hotel is an oldie but a goody. They have been in the luxury hotel business for 50+ years and are very good at what they do. The hotel is furnished really well, the breakfast buffet is scrumptious, the location is good (central but fairly quiet). The staff are really courteous and friendly and everything worked just fine.",3
"Bathroom door was terrible. No hand towel and water bottle provided. Bathroom towel was dirty and has to be changed. Room look looked old and worn out. Out side view is a concrete jungle and very badly maintained and dirty terrace
Breakfast was very good. Staff were polite and courteous",1
"Great staff, Desk Rep Sibasan ( small build guy who take care on desk wearing glasses and dark skin guy)
very Delete repeated word helpful, great food with great environment. I am sure next time I will stay at hotel Savera.",3
ours was a short stay. rooms were well maintained and serviced. we needed a late checkout which was smoothly executed.,3
"Repeated follow ups for hot water and internet didn't fix the problem. The staff was prompt but in a 4 star hotel hot water and internet should not be an issue. 
Room service food was pretty bad and always cold.",2
good experience with hotel. Had good facilities. Near to US Consulate and Beach,3
"Slow check-in, waited 30 mins for check-in. Room and bathroom was not clean. Waited another 20 mins for checkout.",1
It's really hard to believe that now with 3-4k in hand ... You can easily get a room in a 4 star hotel that too with complimentary breakfast. All thanks to MakeMyTrip and yeah the stay was really worth every penny spent. Cheers.,3
"The premises is too good. However there is a problem with cleanliness in swimming pool water, otherwise overall experience is good. The hotel must look at its food menu rates. Better if you booked with Makemytrip app so that you can get best prices than any other travel app.",3
Great stay at Savera Hotel during my official trip to Chennai. Located in the heart of the city. 5 Star hospitality that you could expect from a porter too. Nice rooms and delicious food. Commendable room service. A lot of options in breakfast. Will surely recommend to my dear ones.,3
"Good, please don't disturb by keep asking for review and sending many emails, I don't want any updates and don't force us to write 200 words, I am quite serious about this please don't force me to stop using MMT app.",3
Rooms are well-maintained but corridors are maintained poorly. Stayed only for one night but heard from my colleagues that it is one of best hotel with more than 80 years history. Can try to stay here with family and friend and also convenient for business meetings.,3
Nice and looks good. Better please provide some facilities like Mobile charger and all. Bed is OK but not cleaned well. Rest room is good. Rest of all hotels to compare nice and find. Buffet tiffen is very nice and food is also good.,3
"We were in Chennai for admission of my Son at SRM University. The Hotel was little bit costly. But, stay was very comfortable. Food with different type of variety was mouth watering and tasty. Service was fantastic. Cleanliness and modern facilities are really appreciable.",3
Hotel location is good. It's near to German consulate and shopping malls. Breakfast was superb with many options. Room was comfortable. They have pool and its always occupied. And food quality is good. We had a great stay.,3
"The hotel looked pretty decent from outside. However, the hallway was smelly and dirty. Room was smelling and very stuff. Bathroom was not clean and felt very suffocating. It's not value for money. Service was good and the people were nice. I strongly feel they could have maintained much better.",2
"I liked the hotel, people are very nice, good service. But the room in which I was staying 411 would have smoking smell though it was a non smoking room. Ambience was pleasant, it had pool side hotel too, Swimming pool was also accessible for the guest, we enjoyed that too.",3
"Room was very neat and clean. Business Standard room was quiet spacious. Very good buffet breakfast. There was a gap between floor and main door due to which, you can hear outside corridor noise and vice versa. This may be due to old construction of hotel. Its Gym and Pub - both were really good. It was near to Embassy so easy to move around. Service was good. I would suggest this hotel to others. It was value for money.",3
Hotel rooms were very poor with broken floor boards. Receptionist was not ready to take any feedback and no proper response for questions. I wouldn't recommend Savera to anyone. I was charged thrice the amount mentioned on the snack pack.,2
The hotel is clean and comfortable with a wide choice of food in its three restaurants. Staff are courteous and friendly. There is a very efficient travel desk. My request for late checkout was accommodated readily but the amount charged for a 4 hour over stay beyond their usual allowance of 2 hours was a little pinching when compared to the rate I paid for my 2 nights stay through Make My Trip.,3
Service is good. Just a bit pricey. For the same price a better quality hotel is still possible,3
"The room was good but the health faucet in the toilet was on the wrong side, breakfast was excellent and the overall impression was good. The location of the hotel is central, very close two popular malls.",3
Room was VG. Bit of difficilty figuring out lighting and electricity on/off functions and hair dryer was not working. Over all a good value at paid price. Front desk personnel were PERFECT.,3
It was very nice. I enjoyed my stay there at Raj Park. Amazing.,3
It USB one of the worst experience I had with Raj park,1
"Booked a Deluxe Room with an occupancy for 2 people. The room that we got had below amenities:

1) No Ventilation.
2) The room was stinky(The room was smelling like it was in close proximity with drainage) 
3) Congested (The room was very small)
4) The window opened(open the curtain) into a huge wall which was 2 feet away. Which means forget the natural light you cant even see the sky from the room with an opened window.",1
Very good hotel,3
Overall stay was good .,3
"Breakfast was very excellent,as well room services also good",3
"The hotel is excellent and value for money, thus was my almost 5th or 6th stay at this hotel, I prefer this due to location and near to airport, the hotel staff is courteous and helpful, they have good gym facility also which is handy white travelling to make up your routine workouts",3
Clean room. Polite front desk. Seemed overworked as a single person had to handle many clients. Breakfast had a good spread. Service at the restaurant was good. Good location in Chennai with easy access to all areas.,3
I stayed in the hotel for couple of days. The rooms were excellent and the room service was very good and the support staff were very supportive and helped me out to my request. I would rate the hotel best in it's class.,3
"Please improve the room service. Rooms are not cleaned on a daily basis. Waiters should promptly come to the room when called upon. Besides a very good restaurant. Good food, good location, value for money.",3
The location and the ambience of the hotel is good! But the room was not clean at all. Asked for a room change which was not done. They need to clean the room before allocating. If this is taken care then this is an excellent hotel to stay in the centre of the city.,3
The best part was location. Other things were average. The service in restaurant was not good. Bar was good. Laundry service was good and in time. Quality of food was good. Staff was not smart. Their understanding of language was poor. Hotel was good.,3
0,3
Everything was awesome. They provide mini bar too. There is too much space for luggage and AC is too powerful. Feels like home when we are in this hotel. Food stuff is amazing. Buffet is amazing with lots of dishes snacks and that too free for breakfast and just around Rs 800 for Lunch and Dinner. Just love this Hotel.,3
"This hotel is in a fantastic location, walking distance to good restaurants and shopping. However, Service is very poor. Staff seems very poorly trained and paid, and that is exactly the service quality they offer, breakfast not up to the mark, checkout will take a long time so be prepared to add 15-20 minutes if you have a flight to catch, coffee/tea maker in room dirty and not per a 4 star property.",2
"Pros: Very good location, excellent cleanliness, friendly staff, nice breakfast buffet. Cons: Wi-Fi connection unstable and speed poor, food is very costly. I faced some problem with the locker and room access card, but they were promptly replaced. Except for the two cons mentioned above, very nice experience.",3
Nice stay .... staff interaction and their service is good... satisfied for the paid.....................................................................................................................,3
"Very good room and nice facilities, breakfast was very good feel like homely food. But the negative one is the net access, that the WiFi connection was not working there properly. Otherwise very good room and facilities.",3
It was good. Worth the amount you pay. Location is good. Lot of things available nearby. Will book this hotel again in case I wish to travel to that side of the country. Overall a good and happy experience.,3
Hotel Raj Park is a very good one located in main location of city. The room ambience is very good. Food served is very tasty. The stay is really worth able for the amount we spend. Finally service given is nice. We can reach the hotel very easily from any corner of the city.,3
"1. Very close to consulate and convenient for visa interview and finger printing. 2. Very good breakfast - variety and service. 3. Room was clean and worth it. Overall, top hotel especially for people coming for US visa.",3
"Very unhappy despite paying more, waste of money",1
"Got for a day and night. Nice staff. Upgraded our stay from Deluxe Double to Superior Deluxe upon our arrival. Very convenient for US Visa application center visits, hardly 2.7 Kms from Main center and 1.6 approx from the OFC. Good restaurants near by.",3
Convenient location. Good breakfast.24 hour checkout is very convenient when you have a late night flight.,3
The stay at this hotel was pleasant. The room was very comfortable. The staff was very friendly.,3
"Very pleasant stay. It gave great joy to my family, especially daughters who were out for the first time. Adjoining with EA shopping mall is an ASSET!",3
Excellent stay. The staff was very courteous. Food was very good. Very convenient as it is attached to the mall. Room was clean.,3
"Great hotel. Rooms were clean and large. Hotel is attached to the Express Mall, which is convient. Good service and breakfast.",3
"It was a pleasant stay, for the time we spent in the room. Definitely worth staying in, if one has to spend a night at a hotel in Chennai. Reception was kind enough to check us in a couple of hrs prior to the standard check in time, something I was not aware of prior landing at the hotel.",3
Hotel need good Maintanance and breakfast was poor,2
Amazing,3
it 's got a veg breakfast,2
"Arrogant Starff, the way they treated was horrible, i was terrible disappointed. worst Staff i have ever seen in hotels, and they are really crazy.",1
Hotel room was spacious and very large. The services offered by the hotel personnel are cordial and appreciable. Only discomfort was that the hotel was providing only vegetarian food items. However the adjoining food court in the EA mall was providing all types of food. Overall hotel stay was enjoyable,3
"A++ friendly staff, direct access to the avenues mall, food quality great. Can improve by providing atleast 2 towels for a twin room. Stayed with my family for few days. Enjoyed the stay in e hotel. Will visit again.",3
"Hotel E in Chennai is located next to the shopping mall - express avenue. My stay there was great and memorable experience. The room was very clean, neat and good. Bathroom is spacious and great. More choices of breakfast dishes need to be improved. It is recommended.",3
Food options are less ... Rest is up to the standards. Biggest advantage is it is near to the mall .. You can spend your free time in the mall. Both reside in the same compound.,3
"Hotel is good one which is built inside express avenue mall with wonderful modern look. Food quality was OK ... Type, beautiful lobby area. Location is also good.",3
"Had a pleasant stay. Staff and service is very good. Since the hotel is located in the city, it is very easy to go anywhere and in the free time we can roam in the express avenue mall which is located in the same premises. Would love to stay again.",3
I have a nice stay here. Everything was fine for me. The hotel have an entrance to the shopping mall from the lobby itself. That seems good. The staff of the hotels are very friendly and good behaviour.,3
Hotel is very good and rooms are very clean. The location is very good and it is placed in heart of the city. We can easily access to the shopping mall and it has a good ambience. The staff are good with good hospitality and breakfast is very good.,3
"The best value for money and the beast in luxury. Great interiors, classy rooms. Very good access to mall and transport services. In the heart of the lies this beauty. Food not so great. Great over all.",3
Quiet hotel in the middle of town. Very convenient. Neat and tidy. Laid back. Service takes slightly longer than one expects. Not too much choice on the variety of food. Overall a pleasant and happy experience.,3
"The location was good but the there was no service, you don't get the feeling that you are in a hotel. The room size is good, I found cockroach in my room and I found the hotel to bit expensive for the services.",1
"It was my third visit to this property, excellent location, great people and it was my birthday and they made it memorable by celebrating with me. Awesome food, well maintained spacious rooms and value for money.",3
"I keep coming here, it's a great place to stay at Chennai, but I always find if their customer care are more focussed they can get more out of a regular visitor. I tried connecting with them many time, but they don't offer comprehensive package to suit individual request. Any way, it's like choose your own, and I would be doing so till the time I don't look out of options around.",3
"Overall, good experience. +ves: * Located inside a mall. Convenient location. * Big rooms. * Helpful friendly staff, though the guy at reception was cold but I would not let that cloud my overall good experience with the hotel staff. -ves: * Weird policy of limiting internet to only two devices per room. * No baby chair in restaurant.",3
"Amazing friendly service, convenient location. Would recommend highly.",3
The hotel interior is really modern and spacious. Its strategic location added value for the money. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. In fact they even help us to get movie ticket as we are rushing with our busy schedule. The best of the hotel is its attached to a new shopping mall where you can get A-Z and you don't need to spend money on transport or worried to shop till late night. Definitely will visit this hotel again.,3
Perfect travellers hotel. Great services and wonderful food. The rooms are neat and clean and well kept. The newly furnished rooms are even classy. For regular visitors and tourists absolute value for money. No need of wasting money in needlessly fancy hotels.,3
"The overall experience was very nice at the hotel. The activities were not available in the hotel. I had visited this hotel alone for official tour. All amenities like TV, AC and geyser were available in the room.",2
This hotel is very near to many shopping places and very convenient to restaurants and easy connectivity to almost all requirements and also very affordable to common man. Also good friendly atmosphere you can see many local sight seeing places near by this hotel,3
The food was provided with vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. All amenities were in working condition in the room. The room was neat and clean. The check in and checkout was good. The receptionist was good and co-operative. The transport facility was not provided in the hotel.,3
Everything was good at the hotel. I had booked room in advance. In the hotel activity was conducted. I had visited this hotel alone for official work. I don't have any suggestion for this hotel. The internet connection was provided in the room.,3
"I had been to Chennai in the month of November. Traveling towards the Chennai I stayed in Woodlands Hotel for one night & one day because of due to heavy rain very good accommodation to stay, far from city. Good food but room rent is expensive. But all so OK.",3
"I was going to Chennai at last month for some work & visiting Chennai. Me & my sir stayed at hotel New Woodland. It is a big hotel. They have good swimming pool. We stayed here four days. I was enjoyed at Chennai. Like Gandhi sea beach, Merina sea beach, Golden sea beach & Chennai city centre.",3
The hotel which I like very much in Chennai. But swimming pool is chargeable. I suggest this hotel especially for family people. The hotel have much space for parking. Morning breakfast is very nice & enjoyable.,3
"New woodlands chennai which gave me a homely experience with a luxurious touch for one whole night along with my family. The management totally makes the whole customer with 100% satisfaction.Coming across the food,they are pretty good in providing most Delicious and tasty food as our need.Totally staying here will surely gives you a lively home touch experience. Thank you......",3
Had a very pleasant and comfortable stay. Right from the pick-up to the smooth hassle free check-out. The food was tasty and we had a lot of varieties to taste. The best hotel in Chennai and the staff were very helpful prompt and cooperative. The service was excellent and will certainly recommend.,3
"Great reception, nicely connected to various important places, nice walking area, swimming pool, two restaurants, good South Indian delicious food, security, you can visit with family. Most economical, I stayed in this place for a single night and was quite satisfied.",2
"Extremely helpful staff, clean and comfortable room, splendid breakfast buffet.",3
"The additional bed provided was a disgrace
Did not provide the required sheets or additional towels paid for",3
"We would stay here again. Clean, comfortable, amazing food! Occasionally there were mosquitos in the room.",3
Best hotel with excellent staff specially John with great service at the restaurant. Great staff with great location in the heart of the city what else can you ask for and great value for your money,3
Its a great place to stay. Staff is prompt and perfect place for business commuters. Food is lovely. Location is perfect. I have been staying at this place on regular basis and highly recommend to all as its value for money property. Should have full size or bigger swimming pool.,3
"In just few word, its worth money, absolutely amazing stay, staff will make all possibility to make your stay memorable. I had amazing stay.. It in my favourite list, & I make sure to repeat stay again soon.",3
"The hotel have good facilities. Its hospitality and services are very good. Every waiters are very much polite. In its restaurants, we have many options, too. Just the swimming poor is a little small. TV channel have no HD Channels.",3
"It was very high quality stay. The reservation team were able to handle my special request. Room as very good, with high quality firings. Only sad was part of fluctuating WiFi.",3
"Guess! What greets you when you reach this hotel and just come out of your taxi. No, no garlands or a welcome drink but a bad smell of the drainage, I believe this is just opposite to this property. But other than that hotel is fine and stay was good. Though little dull than compared to other Radisson branded properties.",3
Overall the hotel is a cosy place to stay. But they don't have any added facility for enjoyment. It is located in the hub of the city Nungambakkam. The staff members are very polite and caring. I preferred staying here as I had an appointment at Sankara Nethralaya which is absolutely in the proximity. My conclusion for this property- a wonderful stay!,3
Nice hospitality and cleanliness it value for money you can stay there with family also I will suggest this for you.,3
Good.,3
Conversation was not that much,3
"Beautiful radisson blu with amazing facilities which will amaze you like Honda amaze. With amazing food with different varieties, with awesome service and good location ... Where you meet good people with good thinking with no bad thing in their mind.",3

"The service and stay was nice. The staff were friendly and approachable. The food was good and the ambiance too. I would recommend people to stay in this hotel. The hotel is at a decent distance from the airport, which makes travelling easy. A good stay overall.",3
"A Nice place to live at, a Little expensive though, but luxury comes at cost. All the basics amenities were provided. The hotel has a Nice bar and good three restaurant, the food was good but the in room dining menu was limited. Over all a good place with trained and cordial staff",3
"The best place to stay when in Chennai .. A perfect combo of right location, perfect cleaned hygienic rooms, tasty food, excellent service .. Do visit the place when in Chennai .. Rate it the best place.",3
"Stayed for one night at the hotel. It is centrally located very near Anna Salai road. The rooms are good with all modern amentities, buffet spread is very good, the staff is helpful and ever smiling. Swimming pool is too small. Lobby needs to be made more comfortable with having good seating area",3
"The hotel was in great condition, the service at the hotel lounge was average. The breakfast buffet was excellent, they had the best spread and good food.",3
Fabulous and helpful staff. Great brand new hotel.,3

Cannot imagine staying at another hotel in such times - they have really taken good care of us!",3
"Very nice multi cultural buffet breakfast 
Wonderful on site restaurants",3
It was a wonderful experience .. The hotel is neat and the staffs are friendly too .. Overall recommended for short stays ..,3
The hotel was very clean.  The hospitality was excellent. Friendly atmosphere.  You just feel at home.  Great hotel.,3
Nice good hospitality front desk should be more agile and bell desk should get the luggages as early as possible.That is the only area they have to improve,3
"amenity, breakfast, facility is good compare to it's cost. people are relatively friendly while I am checking out I was requesting a bottle of water which is complimentary in room but they was charging it. 
breakfast is good in terms of variety of fruits and miso soup is available!",3
The club room was comfortable & in pristine condition.Complimentary breakfast with multiple food choices.Overall it was a good relaxing stay.,3
This hotel is one of the best around in the area for both cost and location depending on target venues. For certain businesses in the area (which is a growing hub) it is very convenient.,3
We stayed there for a night. Myself & my friend. We felt that the hotel is value for money. Staff are courteous. Ambience is pretty good. Rooms are well maintainer with good decor and ample facilities. Overall we had a pleasant stay. Thanks MMT for recommending a good hotel,3
"I visit this hotel every month as part of business trips and it is extremely good. Close to Mahindra world city, the hotel has all facilities and service, room quality, cleanliness and hygiene are very good. This is a fairly new property as well. This is must stay and only good hotel if you are planning to visit Mahindra World City area.",3
"The hotel is closer to SRM university main campus. I had some work there and this was the best option nearby. The room, food and service was excellent. The property is only 18 months old and still looks very new. The breakfast spread was of international standard. Overall a pleasant stay.",3
We are happy with our stay and would like to stay again. Hotel Room is very Clean and service is OK.. We can understand the delay in service as that particular day it was crowded. But still there is room to improve in service.,3
I stayed there on business trip. Nicely managed. Got good rates on MMT. Hotel should start good price on meal too for business travellers. Overall recommend to stay if you need to be on that area. It is away from main city.,3
Good Hotel by all means very convenient and cooperative staff. Food is also pretty good it's very close to reputed institutions also automotive hubs. I recommended its the best hotel for stay who have the work those places. This trip was my second visit next time also it's my favourite.,3
Clean and tidy hotel. Staff are very professional. Only disadvantage. Little away from city without any continence stores in the vicinity. Wi-Fi is only limited to 2 users per room. Hotel should consider free shuttle to SRM university. Thus would considerably increase the occupancy.,3
"After about an hour's drive from the airport once you reach the hotel, the first view of this ITC group hotel was quite pleasing. The inside of the hotel and the rooms were pleasant. Staff was gentle and helpful and the food was of good. It certainly was value for money.",3
It was fantastic and value for money. I enjoyed a lot with my dad and brother. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. Room service was perfect.,3
"Compared to the kind of facilities you get in an International Hotel for the same value, this hotel is not a value for money. Not a good choice for food. The overall experience of my stay is below my expectations and little depressing. The dine area is not a good location with in hotel.",2
Nice place for staying if you have work in orgadam and MRV. Quite convenient and may be the best place in that area. Breakfast spread was superb and for dinner as well the variety of foods available for buffet was quite elaborate. On the top of Wi-Fi was good,2
"In short, worth for money. An amazing experience and I definitely liked the breakfast buffet as complementary one. Also the rooms are very spacious and everything is perfect. It will be good if they club buffet dinner with some more tariff.",3
Great stay near industrial hub of oragadam. Beautiful room and facilities. Breakfast was classy. Definitely recommend for stay in both club and deluxe rooms. Hopefully prices are made competitive and more catchy for non business customers.,3
"Didn't liked the food either lunch or dinner.The fitness center is for namesake, have no equipment and trainer. Vary far from airport. Didn't find any good reason to travel so far for ITC brand. Thanks",2
"I hate to have a food, there was no proper food preparation, kindly change the food module and the people are nothing cared about the preparation I feel I lost 3500rs but the stay and views impressed but do please change the food.",2
In general our stay was comfortable.,3
Booked this hotel because they advertised with the view. Picture in the internet looked completely different from the small and shabby room they gave us after we insisted on a view.,1
"Very bad rooms and bed was smelling bathroom taps not working etc
Bad experience",1
Good hotel at the best location with affordable rates. Courteous and helpful staff. The food is good and the service is pleasant. The staff is very honest and they know why I am thankful for their honesty.,3
Throughout night it was noisy because of aircraft landing. The windows are poorly insulated.,1
Nice very good cant complain.,3
Everything was very good in the hotel. The room price was reasonable in the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to upcoming travellers. The activities were not available in the hotel. There was no delay in check in and checkout at the booking office of the hotel. The hotel was value for money.,3
The complimentary breakfast was provided by the hotel.,3
It was nice stay for me in this hotel because the location of the hotel was near to the city only. And staffs was also do operative. But manager of this hotel was tottaly good because I did not face any problem in this hotel related to the service food or anything. For me it was value for money. And if I will come in this city so I will stay here only,3

great,3
"Clean, functional place to stay. Not quite as close to Marina Beach as it states, as we found out when we started walking! Still walkable distance though. Lots of little shops + market stalls around but did not see obvious places to eat. Not an obvious area for foreign tourists to stay as we did not find any other tourists in the area. This is not a problem for us but might be to others.",3
"front desk staffs are really good,they don't have a kitchen so everything you eat comes from outside restaurants...",2
"Crowded Area, plenty of shops nearby. Traffic is very heavy. Wifi password keeps changing everyday. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are average. Worth the price though.",2
"I booked this hotel because of 3 star rating but it is not worth to 3 star. The location of the hotel is in very crowded place and maintenance of hotel is not upto the mark. The bed sheet was dirty, the chair cloth was broken looks 2nd handle, the bathroom has broken wall. Overall not worth for money.",1
I will recommend and prefer to stay in future ... Good service and good staffs,3
"Rooms are very small. But all the amenities are available in room. Free breakfast, newspaper, WiFi. But location of the hotel is in Mirshahibpet market. As it is in a market area so the hotel front area is a little bit congested. Good for short stay.",2
"The hotel staff are rude and not at all friendly. When asked for breakfast they denied later after showing reservation which says breakfast included they said it will be serve @11am. They service sucks big time. Even after reservation, they made us to wait for 1hrs to get room keys. Don't be fooled with other rating. Total the experience was pathetic will never stay in this hotel anytime in future.",1
"I really happy about this hotel stay. the hotel is close to the most visited place in the chennai city.
over roll I'm happy and I'll recommend to my friends.",3
"Excellent staff and facilities, great value for the money. Enjoyed my two day stay here.",3
I like to stay here overnight when travelling via Chennai to or from further south in Tamil Nadu .,3
"Above average

Morning buffet was averge for 5 star hotel. 

Smoking smell thru out the corridor.",2
Good nice hotel. Clean and comfortable,3
"Rooms quite alright, bathrooms clean, bed mattresses out of shape i.e. Curved in the torso region & need changing as they are not comfortable to sleep in, food average, i would not mind staying here again but enough reasons for making it a better place to be in - surely. 6/10.",2
"Really hotel staff is not experienced , on check in I was told its king size bed but in room it's twins and got excused , sorry we are fully booked , no person in hotel to help you with your luggage and also the time take your luggage to put in taxi , no people , no much opotions in breakfast",1
Very present stay.,3
We stayed one night because we had a stop over in Chennai. We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport. We had heard a lot of mixed reviews about the hotel but we didn't have any issues.,3
good,3
"Spacious Rooms, Clean Bathrooms
The services is the one of the worst in this categories of hotels
Check In Time tooooo long.
In room Service Pathetic
Breakfast you will not get anything, looks like you have lost in market, Staffs are not helpful.
Guest Service - No response (phone keeps on ringing, no one to attend)
Check Out - Pathetic,",1
"We were surprised at just how good it is. We loved it, and would certainly stay there if we ever return to Chennai. I congratulate the managers and staff for a job well done.",3
"Very decent staff. Helping nature was good and very near to Chennai central and park station. Overall, good and very safe hotel to stay!!! Market area was also close to the place. You can get taxi or auto easily.",3
Location is very good. It is near to Chennai Central Railway Station only 6 to 7 minutes walkable distance. It is an average hotel and function of the front office also is also rated as average. Regarding the food it is good and room is good but bathroom is so small.,2
There were activities arranged by this hotel. The best part of the hotel was cleanliness and service. The food was good with quality and quantity. I would recommend this hotel to upcoming travellers.,3
The lady receptionist was acting like she owns the bell hotel and said BIG NO for everything that we requested for. She said finally this is not for serving customers at all since you booked from make my trip. Very very bad experience just because of her,2
"It's nice place to go and enjoy, it has everything it. It's one of the best place I went. I really enjoyed it. There is no drawback in the hotel. You can really enjoy the place to see. It need to add some entertainment game with it so, all will love the place.",3
1.11E+249,3
"One of the worse hotel. I have seen in my life specially for single room. Railway track nearby, so whole night you will not sleep also AC noisy. Worse hotel and total wastage of money. I will not advice single person to take room in this hotel. No silence and renovation not upto mark. Totally they made me fool.",1
Hotel rooms are good. Front desk is staff is good. Difficult to communicate to restaurant staff. Food service pathetic also IRD. Acceptable overall. Nothing great. Location is good. If service improved it can be a good hotel. Rooms are not that great facilities can be improved.,3
The hotel was located in the city. The appearance of the hotel was good. I had faced the difficulty in check in and checkout process. All amenities were provided in the room but TV was not working condition in the room. The behaviour of the staff’s was not friendly in the hotel. The food quality was good in the hotel. The activity was not arranged by the hotel.,3
"Rooms are very neat and clean. Staff is cooperative and friendly in behaviour. Hotel is located nearby Chennai central station but I recommend to take taxi for approaching hotel. Food is very delicious. Only thing where I'm not satisfied is that they are providing limited access to wifi. Overall, I give 4 out of 5.",3
"Food service is good and complimentary breakfast was also good. Room service is excellent. Rooms are neat. Yeah people can choose the hotel and main reason to stay is nearby railway station and market area. Overall, to stay in this hotel is good but parking area is not comfortable for four wheeler.",3
"The hotel was super convenient; management was friendly, efficient and effective. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all friends travelling to Chennai. Rooms were spacious, bathrooms clean with quality toiletries and breakfasts were sumptuous.",3
Good value for money. Very neat well appointed room had a very comfortable stay. Very near to city centre. The room had a great view of the sea shore. I would recommend for long stays too as you have washing machine and all cooking range.,3
"The hotel is clean, convenient and good value for money. Staff are courteous and helpful. However, they need more training to be efficient. They are prone to mistakes in taking service and food requests. Buffet breakfast needs improvement. Was my third trip.",3
"Too much good experience with hospitality, cleanliness, facility and privacy and good value for money... To keep mind relaxing... Keep it up... Wanna visit other properties by this Somerset people.",3
Food is expensive .. Other than that a great hotel . .,3
I am deaf. Bar is closed and Restaurant is okay ... It should be more decoration as beautiful. I enjoyed swimming top floor and weather is good,3
"Very Good Service Apartment which gives you a feel of Hotel. Facilities, staff and cleanliness was good. Restaurants can have more options. Locality of the hotel is good. Hotel should provide Valet parking for the cars. Overall experience was good.",3
"Overall, it was good experience. Rooms were spacious and they were kept very clean and tidy. Room service was good. Good dining experience. With swimming pool and lot more. Located close to malls, temple, beach etc. It makes travel more easy. Must visit.",3
"Very good hotel at reasonable price, Location is good, food is excellent and rooms are spacious, Staff is friendly but had taken a long time to check-in than usually happens, Very close to beach and have nice view of the beach from the hotel, prefer for weekend stays with family.",3
Regular stay nothing to write home about. During morning breakfast they ask you to go to reception to collect breakfast coupon. First time I have come across this weird practice. If you order a drink in the room the waiters want you to settle the bill by cash as it cannot be posted in the bill. Most unusual and unfriendly.,2
This is excellent hotel for long term stay and also for family. Lobby is very clean and good. Breakfast is OK. I really enjoyed the shower and the Bathroom is excellent. Good view from my room. I recoded this hotel for all types of stays.,3
"Worth staying, value for money it give all facilities available in any apartment do stay once in your life time",3
"It's one of those places that's the very definition of home away from home. And even better, home that has lovely people helping you out with even the tiniest of tiny things. The staff is just wonderful - Vinod, Prashanth, Ashok.",3
This is an awesome property very well maintained and the service is matching to there standards. The infinity pool is excellent with roof top jacuzzi and we'll equipped gym to take care of your health. Overall excellent.,3
The hotel was located near the iyyappan temple and the surrounding by sea views. The hotel was very good condition for the best price. I really enjoyed the location very well. It was in very hot of the city centre and the service was excellent and value for money.,3
Excellent and renovating stay. Nice room. Great roof top pool and hygienic gym. Food could be better. Also the rates for repeat customer need to be considered. I wanted to extend my stay but due to rates I couldn't continue.,3
"Good, well connected to the city, value for money deals",3
At best I would rate it 4 star. The Restaurant is ok but again nothing like 5 star. The rooftop pool is very good and that's the reason I gave a 4 for facilities. At night you can hear the dogs barking in the street below. Outside the hotel its pretty grim with a lot of rubbish left lying around.,2
Excellent place to stay in Chennai. Almost a 5 star hotel and the staff is excellent. Good buffet breakfast,3
the buffet breakfast was not up to the 4 star category.,3
Washroom was stinking .. House keeping were not active in their job .. They were pretty slow .. Like the pool ..,2
"Lovely few days stay at the Somerset. Rooftop swimming pool was fab. The breakfast at both attached restaurants was varied and lovely to have freshly made parathas!
Although watch out for the evening buffet -well over priced.
Room was great with everything you'd want if you were staying for a long period.
Staff were polite and helpful.
We'd certainly recommend the Somerset!",3
"Hotel and facilities are good. But checkin staff was very rude and arrogant. Was not welcoming, and was brusque with the paperwork. Didn't inform us of breakfast timings and so we missed it inadvertently.",2
Repeat customer. Very accomodative with late checkout request.,3
"Stayed there for 2 days with family. Hotel was very clean, comfortable and comparable to international hotel chains. Would definitely stay there again.",3
"Descent security check, Warm welcome, good escort to the room and briefing, nice breakfast,other usual comforts.on the whole I enjoyed my stay. Thank you",3
"Air conditioning will need further maintenance. For a 5 star hotel my room was very musty and needed to be changed. In addition, the temperate gauges did NOT work on my air condo and thus the room was freezing.

For events, the staff was really good and cooperative",3
"Really enjoyed the Japanese and Chinese restaurants, menu and food were excellent. Rooms were clean and quiet. Used the shuttle service everyday and was very easy. Will stay again next time I am in Chennai for work.",3
I had a bad experience and will not visit this hotel again,1
"Very comfortable, there was an excellent selection of breakfast and dinner. Watch out for overpriced bottles of water though! 

The staff were extremely helpful. 

 Lovely outdoor swimming pool - but very dark in the evenings - could do with better signage and lighting.",3
"Hotel is not a 5 starts hotel anymore.
The neighborhood is in construction so you can't get out by walking.
The hotel has a ballroom so they have parties every night and you can hear it in the room (7th floor).
Breakfast is mostly Indian, so if you don't like Indian food you're in trouble.
The free WI-Fi is lousy",2
Over all its great and pleasant services from entrance,3
My fifth stay at the hotel for business. Rooms are great and the restaurants are excellent although not cheap. The room service menu is very good though and reasonably priced. The best part about the hotel is the staff who are very friendly and always helpful.,3
enjoyable,3
"Most impressive service by staff in all areas. Good restaurants and fitness center. Beautiful hotel. Love the creative way the bathroom is set up that makes it both beautiful and functional. Love the many shelves in room and bathroom. However, the grout in the shower area looks like it needs some deep cleaning. Still, had a wonderful time at the hotel.",3
"The linens were smelling bad, and the elevators had a pungent odour. The housekeeping was not up to par of a 5 star hotel. They didn't clean the rooms regularly, I had a big argument with the housekeeping manager.

Doorman Syed and K. Subramani from Bell Services made my stay comfortable, even with these ordeals..",1
"Stayed at the Hyatt in Chennai for the first time and was a refreshing change from the other hotels in the city.
Great rooms , brilliant food and the location could nt be better.",3
We had a great experience STAYING IN THE HOTEL when we had visited Chennai for a short stay,3
"The cleanliness was appreciated.
The hotel is also well situated in the center of town and shopping area.",3
The hotel facilities are really good.The buffet breakfast is really taste and good varieties.,3
"This hotel is in good location, but room services and cleanliness leaves lot to expect.",2
"Very happy with my stay at Radha Regent. Very friendly hotel staff, facilities and the buffet was excellent with lots of variety.",3
"We a family of 3 stayed for a day at Radha Regent, The Room size was ok.The toilet was good,The extra bed provided was a ramshackle piece.The Breakfast was splendid and the staff highly professional.Parking was hassle free.",3
Good,3
The location next to bus stop on bangalore to chennai route was what drew us to this motel. It is quite nice inside. The breakfast buffet was amazingly good with lots of Indian and Continental breakfast items.,3
"Hotel is simply good
But booking through expedia has made it miserable.
Very poor communication. 
Inthr hotel wifi is poor.",3
"Satisfied with hotel cleanliness, staff support and breakfast.",2
The rooms were spacious and breakfast really good. Felt like spending some more time but had to rush for some commitments. The resto-bar has a classic set-up. Didn't quite look out for the gym. Planning to stay here in future when travelling with family.,3
"Excellent hotel. Very good hotel at peak location. Service is excellent including 24 hours room service. Good ambience, complimentary breakfast is awesome with large variety of items. 100% I am satisfied.",3
Had a good time. Worth of money the ambience excellent and attentive service by staff. Varriety of food option and bars and security and safety standards very high. Laka,3
"Hotel room is just average. Washroom was not cleaned at the time of check in. Would not recommend. Gym was average, overall not value for money. Very old property not upgraded at all.",1
"Very good hotel at peak location. Service is excellent including 24 hours room service. Good ambiance, complimentary breakfast is awesome with a large variety. However the room facilities can be better, that would be like icing on the cake. All over very pleasant stay.",3
I stayed in this hotel on 28 June 2016. Stay was nice. Service was excellent. Breakfast menu was good with lots of variety for veg and non veg. Hotel location is also easy to locate. Overall experience is good and I will recommend to stay in this Hotel.,3
Stayed only 10 hours... Good experience. The break-fast is excellent... Especially hospitality in restaurant ( Breakfast) is good. Even though it is complementary they value their customers Only one thing which is not changing in India... The reception people start calling from 11 O clock for check out... Every one knows we have to check out at 12 noon... At least start calling after 12 if gets delayed.,3
Friendly staff with excellent breakfast. The only draw back was the music at Geoffrey's was too loud and conversing was next to impossible. Nice concept of smokers and non smokers room as generally in a room where a person smokes the room smells of tobacco.,3
It was a very good stay. We enjoyed our stay. The ambient and facilities were good. The food was good and the services were prompt. But they would have added Business news papers availability for the guest to keep them abreast of business developments and current business news. Overall it is very good.,3
"cvpisfivfsgfofgfogfaomfmgoimfdogfdogfdojgofjdgjfajgfisjgmfvkmfkdmvfmgifmgiofamvmf,vmlfmvofmvofmvofvmfmvofmvmfmvfmvmfmlifmgmflgfgagfkgksfdkgl;kflgkskg;laskg;lskgksgk;skag;skgs;kgksdf;kkdskfdskfkdskf;dlskf;ldksf;kds;fkdskfkds;kf;sdkf;daskfkds;fk;dslkfdskf",3
Rooms need some refurb as it looks old and the toilet need to have proper bathing space. Though it is not in the centre of the city it is easily accessible. Food is OK. Other amenities are good.,3
Very good hotel. Nice service. One of the best hotel and well trained employees. Excellent food. Really delighted experience for two days. I had stayed with family. My son really enjoyed during stay in this hotel.,3
Nice place to stay with family at reasonable price. Food is really delicious. Rooms are very neat and clean and the place is really pleasant. WiFi facility is good. Value for money. Always my first choice in Chennai is Radha regent.,3
I liked it very much. I recommend my friends and relatives to book room in your hotel. Food was very delicious. I like buffet system. Free breakfast idea is very nice and attractive yummy dishes.,3
Though I have stayed in several Sarovar Hotel across India. This was my very 1st stay at Radha Regent Chennai and overall experience was good. Location and hospitality was excellent. And service and cleanliness of the room was good. I will prefer Radha Regent for future stays and refer to my friends to Radhika regency.,3
I have stayed at the radha many times due to its location for my business. The rooms are run down and basic with need of updating. The noise level at night due to live music within the hotel is annoying but is over by midnight. That said the service is always exceptional and the food in the lobby lounge is also excellent.,2
It is an ideal place for the price. Good restaurant. Very close to textile & jewellery hub of T Nagar. Other good veg restaurants are also close by. Though it is a small building easy to locate. I recommend strongly for frequent travellers.,3
"Queens way park was good hotel to stay for corporate people, but inside staff are not much educated and unprofessional behavior. Complementary breakfast are not much good, quality of food also not much worth. Inside room was good and cleanliness, I loved it. Overall hotel was below average and costwise to stay at this point of time OK.",2
Located in prime area. Budget hotel with clean and neat rooms. Food is very good. However non availability of flexi check out (12 noon strictly followed) and very few staff to assist in room service is only problem. Very good hotel for short stay though.,3
The Hotel is good and clean. But the breakfast spread is poor. The Food quality is average and no much options to choose from,3
"Everything is Excellent ... Location - Heart of the City, Food - Awesome, nice Hotel, Easy Connectivity, Prices also reasonable, worth. Good Hygiene",3
"Was on a business travel, good hotel.. Stay was good except the breakfast served.. Not much variety & WiFi was slow. Beverage kept in Mini Bar way too costly. Overall as it was close to the place I wanted to visit, & just one day.. No issue.",3
"It was pleasant stay, rooms are decent, service was very good. Very good location too. Only one issue I have faced was - Internet availability for first 2 days was issue. Once I spoke to reception, they have fixed it on next day. Overall its value for money.",3
Good place. Good food and good service. Everything at the hotel is worth for the money spent. Overall I had a great stay at Queensway Park. I will definitely come back again for a stay at the hotel.,3
"No cleanliness, rooms full of mosquitoes, pathetic service, OK food. Never suggest to go to this hotel. Very limited options of breakfast and dinner. Mediocre quality of food",2
"Good one, recommended. Liked the hotel and their services. Hotel location is also ok. The rooms are comparatively bigger than the tariff. Cleanliness is also good. Staff are well mannered and services are good. Breakfast is also good and room service as well.",3
The staff is really nice. The rooms are good and it is in a good location as it is near many stores. The breakfast served is also good. It is good for both family and business travellers. I would recommend it to my friends and family. It is worth the money paid.,3
"Overall a decent place to stay. The location is perfect, easy to find. The rooms are also good. The only disadvantage is the restaurant. It doesn't have a lot of variety to choose from. Even the place is pretty small. However the taste was very good. Hotel staff is also courteous and made it a very good experience for us.",3
"Good one, recommended. Liked the hotel and their services. Hotel location is also ok. The rooms are comparatively bigger than the tariff. Cleanliness is also good. Staff are well mannered and services are good. Breakfast is also good and room service as well.",3
Value for money for sure. Very courteous front desk & all staff. Clean room. Everything good. Would surely recommend. Good for family as well as for business travellers. Breakfast (included) was good enough for the price of the room. It's restaurant is though little bit highly prices but not very expensive. Location is good in T. Nagar. Also railway station walking distance. Overall a good experience.,3
"Hotel dhik dhak hai.rate ke hisab se achi hain, lekin nasta average tha,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@##@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@××@×@@@@@×××××××××##@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@",3
Not worth 5k for a night. 5 star hotels in chennai are around the same price. Not at all worth the price at this hotel.,2
"It's a decent hotel located close to Marina beach and a few good restaurants, very friendly staff.",2
Excellent location with best vegetarian food available in the city. Easily accessible in the heart of city. Regarding WiFi it's bit slow and room cleanliness is bit average. Can improve a little bit on these two aspects.,3
"Hotel is very neat and clean, breakfast was very tasty and lot of varieties were there. Staff is very polite. Its a pure vegetarian hotel but nearby we are having good option to have non veg. Two to 3 malls are nearby only.",3
"Except for Location, there is no value for money. Poor Service. No hot water. Not provided proper linen. Despite complaint to Front Desk, no action was taken, No alternative room was provided. Due to proximity to US Consulate, we have stayed there. Else a Strict NO.",1
Hotel is very nice with pleasant ambiance.. Rooms are very good.. Only problem is with hot water.. We will not get hot water continuously.. Have to cal them many times and after half an hr we get them.. Complimentary breakfast provided is not of good quality.. Apart these two it is very nice hotel to stay.. It is very close to beach and also malls.,3
Nice hotel,3
From airport and central station reachable distance service and neatness is good location is excellent no pollution calm and silent hotel rent affordable,3
"Good neat and clean. Centrally located near to railway station, near to beach. Veg hotel and worth staying for the tariff. Rooms are good and near to mylapore temple. For family stay is also good. Good restaurant with only veg. No egg also they make. Pure veg",3
"Nice place to stay, center of Chennai, parking facilities good, cleanliness is good more is needed, noisy at night, light was coming inside the room while sleeping curtains need to prevent light entry needs to be done, little expensive for the facilities, food for breakfast, more needs to be done.",3
"Too good. Centrally located, clean rooms, fantastic hospitality, uber and OLA cabs can reach easily, beaches are just 2 kms away, decent locality, good food, fine dine and bar, awesome service, cool ambience etc....",3
The hotel is located very ideally which makes it easily accessible for people travelling for work. The hotel rooms are decent and clean. Service needs improvise though the staff are friendly. Booking the room through make my trip was a brilliant experience and with the fantastic offers the deal seemed very appealing.,3
"This was my second visit to DP. My first one was good so I booked the same hotel for my 2nd visit. But this time the experience was pathetic. There was cockroaches on the dining table at Olives. The toilet sink was open and stinking every time the tap was open, no hot water on both days, the bathroom door doesn't lock, corridor doesn't smell fresh. Dont ever order their in -room food. Its ultra expensive and not good.",2
Food facility was available at this hotel. The food quality was good. The hotel was nearby the mall. The behaviour of staff's and executive was good. I had visited this hotel with my family. Parking facility was available at this hotel. Gym facility was available at this hotel. The appearance of the hotel was good. The check in and checkout service was done on time. Wi-Fi service was available at this hotel. The hotel was value for money.,3
Deccan Plaza,3
". .........................................................................................................................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,...............,,,,,,,,,,,...............,,,,,,,,,,,",3
Good one. But not so good for the money which you are paying there. Especially for the food. But service was good and room was very good. I will recommend this hotel to others as it's got a good location and easily accessible.,3
"I booked this hotel for 1 night on 18th May, the hotel and its staff are very well mannered and helpful, in all a pleasant stay, thanks to Makemytrip and Deccan Plaza and veg breakfast buffet is very good, rooms are OK. Cons:- The bed-sheet had stains which was changed on informing.",3
"NOT VERY HAPPY WITH HOTEL STAFF VERY GOOD
VERY CLOSE TO US CONSULATE
VERY CLOSE TO RESTATURANTS
NEAT LOCATION",2
Ok good,3
"Hotel is located in a central place. Nearby shopping place.

Hotel staff are friendly and services are good.

Hotel is maintained well.",3
"I checked in late and I had my visa interview the next day, I requested them for a late checkout around 3-4, since my flight was in the evening but the staff was so rude that they refused me on the face for the same. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. I had to sit in their lobby until I was supposed to leave for my flight. The room was also not so clean and hygienic",1
"Cleanliness of room,/hotel, Hotel location",3
"Very good location, ideal for US Visa interview and roaming around.",3
Stay at the Hotel is satisfactory. We are not aware the Hotel has 24 hours checkout policy. Only on 3rd day morning they have informed that we should checkout at 8.30 am and we felt something strange. As per their desire we checked out at 9.00am.,2
Nice Hotel. Excellent helpful Staff. Pleasant Stay,3
Great Experience,3
"Best place to stay in Chennai. Friendly staff. Wish they have 24 hours check out policy, had to pay extra money to stay extra 4 hours in spite of staying and paid for 3 nights. Little bit flexibility would help international passengers flying in and out of Chennai. K",3
"Always up to the exacting standards of Taj hotels, especially in India. This one feels very corporate though. Rooms are a bit small – even though we had what was supposedly a club room. Service was excellent – great staff, especially at breakfast, always at hand to assist. Breakfast was truly awesome. The Taj hotels we have stayed at (in India) simply have the best breakfasts in the world – no other hotel group comes close",3
Very nice hotel with excellent accommodations and service. Don't miss the pool - it is a peaceful paradise in the middle of a busy city. The hotel staff went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and that our stay was perfect.,3
A pleasant stay. Staffs are friendly and polite. Clean and comfortable,3
It was good,3
"Hotels.com should advise customers of other charges .
I was not aware of a luxury tax and other charges which pushed the price considerably .",3
In this Hotel everything is catered for. There is no effort spared by the staff to ensure your stay is perfect.,3
"Staff are very well trained and quite helpful and not helpful to the point of being annoying.
At check in, I asked to first see the room, I was shown a room that seemed small and not updated, I was shown a room that has been renovated which turned out to be perfect !!",3
"A top class hotel in the heart of Chennai with a diverse set of amenities, sure to please visitors from all parts of the world.",3
"Rude and unfriendly staff behaviour, will never book again to spoil my trip in a bad place. The staff and management are just dumb and the don't have any aticate and policies that can help a client in a helpful manner. Will never visit this place again and make sure none of my friends will.",1
Ms. Shobana at the front desk and mr Sivaraman at the South Indian restaurant were extremely thoughtful. The room was comfortable. The pastry shop in the lobby is brilliant. Very warm and courteous environment.,3
It was a superb hotel. The appearance of the hotel was good. The reception of the staff’s was very friendly in the hotel. The complimentary breakfast was not provided in the hotel. The lunch and dinner was not included in the package. I had visited this hotel for business purpose. I would not recommend this hotel to upcoming travellers. I don’t have any suggestion for this hotel. The overall experience of the hotel was excellent.,3
"Staff made us feel at home. We were always greeted with little surprises like goodies for my child, a soveniour for my wife. Room service and cleanliness were of top quality. We also had a great dinning experience in southern spice.",3
"Hotel was very accommodating and front desk staff, security personnel were good and pleasant to deal with. The hotel's offering on food is very limited and choice of international cuisine needs improvement. All staff were very courteous, polite and welcoming. The hotel is clean and well maintained.",3
"The hotel was located in center of the city. The taste of food was good. You can feel the warmth of the staff. While checking out my card was not working, the staff helped me regarding that and their politeness impressed me. Everything was perfect, except arrival experience",3
its very good im very enjoyd and it near to the transport sorces to railway station and hotel look was very beautifull in and out look but improv the services in the hotel food also niss but no activities in the hotel ....beautyfull stay in hotel its niss location ..... ........................................................................,3

Hotel location and servicing and treating the customer is very excellent. Facility given by taj is very good. Customer receiving and behaving also very good. No drop back in hotel. All the things done by them is very good. Keep going. Improve some more option,3
Well maintained and super service. Breakfast is very good with multiple options. Room has audio music system for music lovers. Comfortable stay. Located in heart of city. Welcome during check-in is very traditional. Hotel is worth recommending and great value for money.,3
"Its a Good hotel and its fore to the beach, The rooms was very good and there service is also good. They have a pool to play, but its small. You must visit the place in Chennai. Nice hotel and there food was good. And there are some more places to visit with family & friends.",3
Really it was good and Excellent internet to use in the hotel. And also i love this hotel very much. Very high rich of foods to eat. Noone can beat them in Hotel allignments. I think it should not a 5Star. it should be a 10 Star hotel. more varities to rooms. and etc and etc....,3
"This was one of the best hotel stays in India we have had. This was a value for money experience with excellent hotel facilities, great food and, above all, very well trained staff who were all very courteous and went out of their way to make this a great hotel experience.",3
"Trivago listed the hotel as near to MEPZ but it was actually ~20kms away. But no complaints. it took us only 45 min in peak hours and 30 min in non-peak to and fro office.
Good overall experience. There is no lift and that's a big dampener. Good Wi-Fi connection and hassle-free too. Good Food. Recommended",3
The place is simple for a business stay. The food cooked in house kitchen is clean and freshly made.,2
Don't try this hotel as these people do not have restaurant and will provide only toasted breads for breakfast. Poor parking facilities and no geyser at all. It's only solar heater water and doesn't get hot water only. Western toilet sucks and lights are poor,2
I have got the chance to stay at this hotel. The staff are very courteous with good attitude towards guests. It has got food facility also and the staff takes utmost care to attend the individual needs. The management is keen to take feedback from guests to enhance their service.,3

in our journey we were worried about the place to stay with the help of these staff people we were able to get rid of our worries plus the rooms are adorable the site is great my wife loved the place we will be coming back soon thanks for such an good experience.,3
"It was an awesome experience in hotel Hyatt. We enjoyed a lot, had a great time. Had a remarkable time & enjoyed there hospitality they have provided. The hotel was a five star hotel.

"The customer service was very good..The dining experience and service was excellent and the room quality was very good.. the spa experience was also pretty good. 

The location and congestion around the location was inconvenient.",3
We stayed one night at this hotel on transit from colombo to londo. the air conditioning in the whole floor and in our room was badly defective resulting in significant dampness throughout this part of the building. we felt this hotel was basically uninhabitable.,1
nice service,3
"i came here for official work
The hotel made it so much more convenient and pleasurable
The staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way
I will definitely stay here again",3
Stay was very very comfortable. Good service. Large rooms. Good of options both for breakfast and dinner. Value for money,3
The hotel was good. The Wi-Fi facility was provided in the hotel. The pickup and drop facility was provided in the hotel. The best part of the hotel was location. I don’t have any suggestion for this hotel.,3
One of the best hotels in Chennai. Ambience is good but I do not think it is well received by visitors. Never plan to travel Auto's in Chennai. You travel experience will not be good. Hotel also providing shuttle services also when required. Service is fabulous. You will love it.,3
Everything was very good in this hotel. The activity was available at the hotel. I had visited this hotel for official trip with my family.,3
"""We had a marvelous stay in Chennai at courtyard Marriott. Wonderful interiors, very good service and some excellent dining too, must recommend the hotel's Esenin Restaurant for the blini and caviar and some exquisite salmon dishes. Very reasonably priced too for a luxury hotel.",3
"Hotel staff, especially at Paprika restaurant were very cordial and helpful. They went out of their way to help us.",3
bathroom ciel was leaking with water. not a good option to stay in chennai,1
The hotel is very well situated although the latest work by the Chennai metro has made the approach a little cumbersome and also in traffic time can take a few extra minutes to reach. The hotel has sniffer dogs to sniff cars and seems to but very security conscious. The rooms are nice and the food also good. It has the class of the marriott chain.,3
"A fine day, I went for a dinner, it is really good the way they served the quality of the food and the taste is also very fine. The positive is the valet parking and the negative of the hotel is if a food got over it takes some time for them to fill it back.",3
"One of the nice hotel compared to other hotel. Room is so spacious, food is so tasty and delicious. Bed is comfortable and mattress are so good, it is near to city, all facilities are available. Hot water facility is also available, room is so clean and appearance of the hotel is good.",3
"This is one of the best hotel in the city clean and modern hotel room was nice. Staff were very helpful and polite.

Front view of hotel is very good. Hotel service is good. Overall very pleasant stay. I would definitely recommended to all visitors to Chennai.",3
Had an excellent stay in Chennai. Courtyard Chennai is located at a very prominent location. Nice welcome and excellent ambience. Food is also excellent but costly. The executive lounge provides you the mood to relax. The leisure facilities like swimming pool is very good. Would like to stay once again.,3
"Had very good experience. I stayed in this hotel with my friends. The staff of this hotel is very helpful and quick. A/C facility is available. Its location is well-maintained also the water is very neat and clean. Special foods are available here. The weather is perfect. All kinds of foods are available here. Overall, a very pleasant stay. Love to visit again soon.",3
"Not as comfortable as other Courtyards in India, especially decoration etc.",2
Big rat in the room couldn't sleep.. had the US visa next day.. would recommend it very old hotel bulding and it smells,1
Had a great stay. very helpful and attentive staff. went out of their way to provide the odd request. pleasant. salon a bit slow and not up to the mark,3
People @ this hotel serve / take care of the guests very well and make you feel comfortable.,3
Good,3
"liked the peaceful environment, generous and healthy cuisine at the restaurant, daily newspapers, prompt response to my requests and the very polite and very courteous front desk personnel.",3

Stay was awesome,3
Very good and comfortable stay. Location is excellent.,3
I had requested for a king size bed while booking. What the hotel provided were twin beds . Except that the stay was comfortable,3
This is a comfortable stay hotel with friendly staff. The location is central and next to a high end shopping mall.,3
we had a comfortable stay again at Green Park. The staff are great and look after you well. We really enjoyed the breakfast too.,3
"average amabiance and comfort of lobby,breakfast room",3
"Barbeque option nice especially if we do not like spicy food.
Shopping mall opposite very interesting.",3
"excellent experience, courteous staff, clean and nice ambience, good food",3
"The good - Very nice hotel building, nice room, clean, good TV channels, not bad gym, breakfast good but same every day - ok if staying only 1 or 2 nights only. The bad - Extract fan in bathroom didn't work, Some of the front desk staff were not friendly, tried to overcharge on extra bed when already included in price, only Indian food good from room service avoid western food.",3
"Easy access to shopping, mall and transportation to the city and airport. well maintained facility. hotel room maintenance staff is friendly and helpful. Check in process could be improved with friendly staff at the counter especially during late evening.",3
"Good place to live, but was very expensive. Food was good had lot of varieties. I would recommend only if the nightly price is little less.close to everywhere. Shopping, good food spots, easy to commute around. I stayed for 4 days. Had it been cheaper in price it would have been better.",2
"I stayed at the Green Park Hotel for 5 nights and found the overall experience very satisfying. The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was good and it was great to have the Forum Mall right next door with no major roads to cross. I would easily recommend it to others.",3
"I stayed for a day in aloft and the food was amazing.. Liked the room as well but could have been better as it was short of pillows and towels. All the other basic amenities are present and would give 4 star for the food alone and 3 star for the overall, experience.",2
Nice hotel. In midst of busy it corridor... Well located... Clean... Nice breakfast... Rooms though are quiet small are well maintained... Well equipped gym area... And pool drawback is no driver dormitory.,3
Good services. Good environment. Rooms are very clean and safe. All varieties items are good. Aloft hotel cost are good in comparison of any services. Suppose we want any facilities they provide on time. Aloft Hotel cost is less in comparison of other hotel.,3
Aloft - standard not maintained. Not very clean. The bedspread had stains... Aloft is an international chain and their standard abroad is completely different and is on a different scale. A lot needs to be done to maintain the same standard. An okay experience but not worth the money and the brand.,2
It was a very good experience staying at your hotel. All facilities are perfect and ambiance is very good. Service is very good. Food quality is excellent. I enjoyed my stay looking forward to stay here in future.,3
Wonderful stay in Aloft. Food was good. Nice hospitality services. Breakfast was free and was of good quality. Room was clean and decent one. Hotel staff was also very helpful. I stayed there for one day and it was a nice and great experience for me.,3
"My experience of this hotel was superb with excellent hospitality, good food and great ambiance. A perfect place to stay if you are travelling with family. Comfortable rooms, extremely supportive staff who take care of all your needs. Surely gonna visit again!",3
Good and pleasant stay this onward journey in my home state and I greet them to keep all the time best .,3
Very good in hospitality services. I must thank to each and everyone who did service for my stay. Good food. Good room service. I have stayed there for 3 days and all the three days has been a good experience for me. Very wonderful stay in Aloft.,3
"Overall the stay was good, though the room service was below expectation. When we requested the hair dryer to be replaced (which was out of order), it took them a cool half an hour to so. Some other room service request (for room slippers, towels etc) took quite awhile too. The reception seems to give a cold welcome which we did not expect from ALOFT, as we have stayed in other ALOFT hotels before and the welcome was warmer than here in OMR.",3
Great experience. I just visited the place for a little while for a get together with my office mates. Amazing ambiance and a super cool pub. Awesome food and drinks. The place is neat and clean. A good luxury experience. Service was great in-spite of the crowd with no delay.,3
"I stayed in Aloft and was a good experience. The rooms were neat and tidy, spacious for double occupancy. Room service was prompt and good. Food was good especially the complimentary buffet breakfast. WiFi connection was also working fine. Overall a good hotel to stay.",3
"Friendly staff but lack of process and quality visible everywhere. Food was fine for an average Indian guest, but my colleague didn't had any great choices. A bar with fewer options, housekeeping staff who needs multiple reminders, made the stay to the other side of expectations, especially to someone who is experienced with an Aloft stay in some other country.",3
Aloft is near the global hospital where we were admitted a relative and we stayed here for a night. It's a cozy place with a great restaurant called dot yum. We visited the restaurant and gorged on their lamb chops and chicken salad. Both were yum unfortunately our medical stay got extended and we had to shift to a service apartment. Will definitely drop in again on our next trip to Chennai.,2
"It has refreshing look, definitely not a traditional style of hotel what we see elsewhere. If I stay near Sholinganallur, this is the place. I stayed nearly 1 month didn't feel boring. They do have attached bar and restaurant with nice food. It's a quite a place to relax from business schedule.",3
"I always overlooked the funky lightings and the offbeat decor but one thing I can't get used to is the room itself. No storage space for clothes, odd shape of the room,the ac location which makes the room too cold or too hot and very ordinary service at the restaurant just makes it a bad place for business travellers.",2
"I like to stay here because the location has many options for eating and other shopping needs.

I have stayed many times here and things are perfect. At few points, I feel that it is little over priced.

Hotel is in excellent condition.",3
The hotel is modern hotel and the room was very comfortable. The staff were very pleasant. It is some distance from the airport and there is nothing around the hotel.,3
was really good :),3
Experience was good. I couldn't spend much time at aloft as I have come for an official purpose. The ambience is very good in the hotel.,3
"Facilities: Modern; Value: Inexpensive; Service: Go the extra mile; Cleanliness: Delightful; 
overall excellent in location for price.",3
"Really so good
The quality of food has to be taken care of",3
It was great pleasant and memorable experience for me during the stay at Le Royal Meridien Chennai. The staff and crew are very professional and friendly. Special thanks to the the manager who helped me in celebrating my specie day here at the Hotel.,3
"Was a very pleasant stay, everything was super good from rooms to staffs to ambiance, food so forth !!!",3
Though hotel offers 24 hour stay for make my trip booking it is 12 noon highly objectionable. The price appears to be high for make my trip guests. Please contact them to remove the discrimination to make booking through make my trip more economical.,3
"Not quite like a 5 star experience , It is barely at a 3 star standard at present. Needs to do a lot of Improvement",2
"It was a nice staying here at this hotel

I would stay at this hotel next time but I was annoyed that I had to pay for wifi service",2
"As we had booked hotel for different date by mistake and requested for prepone the booking for which MakeMyTrip has well accepted, but on personal visit request also Hotel Staff didn't supported.for which spent almost 1hour over phone with MakeMyTrip executive and in the hotel reception.",1
"When I checked in last time, the service I received is very horrible. We stayed 2 person in a room. When we asked for water, they are on chargeable basis. Also @ nyte when we ordered food, they confirmed food is available and after half and hr i. e by 11:00 they are telling that, kitchen is closed. Food is not available. I",2
I had visited this hotel for official trip. The food quality was good. The activity was not available at the hotel. All amenities were provided in the room. The behaviour of staff’s was good in this hotel. I would not recommend this hotel for upcoming travellers. I don’t have any suggestion for this hotel.,2
"Our stay at the hotel was very disappointing, on arrival the wifi was not working. The toilets are smaller than the cupboards. No other facility is available and cleanliness is also bad. The service for breakfast is great though and I appreciate that but for the rest I guess it was all a waste and unpleasant stay.",2
Located centrally. Value for money. I should specially appreciate Mr. Prabhakar at restaurant for breakfast. Superb service. I definitely like to stay again. I will recommend superior rooms which are really awesome. Good hospitality and front office response is good.,3
"I have stayed in this hotel for a day but experienced very bad. The rooms are very small and not spacious and comfortable. The look from outside is good, but not hygienic one. Breakfast complementary but there is no variety available. The price is so high, but not worthy to stay. Can find a good hotel in the same surrounding at same cost. Overall, not so good experience with this hotel.",2
"My flight to Chennai arrived in the middle of the night and I got to the hotel about 5.30am, realising I couldn't get into my room until midday. However the guy at the front desk let me have the room at 8am which I greatly appreciated.",3
It was nice experience of stay in hotel. Hotel is located at the heart of the city. Very close to the railway station and bus stand so it will save time & money. Complementary breakfast was delicious. Recommended for stay for business /leisure / to see the city.,3
"this is very good and decent place in chennai, near airport.. all set when i have arrived. thanks much. will come back again )",3
There are lot of hidden charges in this hotel. I ended up paying around 50 % extra above the room rate in addition to the tax. I never stay back here.,1
Very near to airport. Staff are polite/,3
"Do not book this hotel. Got the worst room I have ever seen in a 5 star hotel in India

In the new room the faucet was loose and was ready to fall off

Avoid this hotel",1
"The hotel was almost k.The staff peple were responsible with their duties.All are doing there joke upto the mark,But only few buggs,Overall the room are well ventilated amd could find few more things that are not much used.Overall i feel good with this.Rooms are not that much clean.I enjoyed your hotel company but not that much.Overall i hope its a gud time in ur hotel",3
The carpet in the rooms and corridor need upgrade. Trash cans are full of rust and have holes in the bottom.,2
"Superb staff, great food and amazing spa treatment. Love the lobby. Rooms are super spacious but needs a little brighter lights and more plug points. I was upgraded to a large room and my friends were in a different hotel and their room was modern but very small.",3
Cockroaches in the bathroom! Decent food and service.,1
THE APPEARANCE IS GOOD AND THE STAFF CO-OPERATION ARE VERY GOOD. AND THE FOOD NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED A LOT. ROOM SERVICE SHOULD BE IMPROVED WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH TV BUT THE MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT COULD NOT ATTEND ON TIME SO I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS. THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE IN THE FRONT DESK ALSO NEED TO IMPROVE.,2
"Shabby, musty rooms with cracked mirrors & washbasin. A rusted in-room electric kettle and an in-room controller that is on perpetual date 14 June.",1
very good hotel at a nice location.service is good and view are adorable.rooms are good and service is also very good.food is ok. staff are friendly.must visit this hotel once.welcome drink and staff behaviour was good.room service was also good.i like to visit this hotel once again in future.,3
"The comfort Inn is really a comfortable hotel for the tourist's, it was amazing to stay in that hotel actually! Overall the infrastructure of the hotel was excellent and I am excited to stay there for the best service that they have done for me with group! I'm sure that I would like to be there for some other time.",3
"We usually visit Bangalore once in every six months and we prefer comfort while staying for we always choose Comfort Inn which has good reception. Rooms are awesome with maximum facility. In a place like Bangalore, it is very difficult to get parking space but we get good parking lot. Restaurant is good, not much expensive. Overall, rating is very good.",3
"I have stayed in Hotel Comfort Inn for couple of days. Its a very good facility in the heart of the city suitable for stay with family at reasonable rate. facilities and other arrangements are value for money. The have disciplined room service system. Lift facility is available. Overall, It was a nice experience for me at Hotel Comfort Inn, Bangalore",3
Everything was good and it was a peaceful stay. Food was extraordinary. Rooms are very clean and services were good as well.,3
This is a good option for business travelers in Chennai. It would have been even better if they had provided free airport pick up and drop off like Radisson,3
"Hotel facilities are good, Staff at reception poor",2
Spacious rooms and good breakfast buffet. Pool is small. Beach facing rooms . Overall we had good stay,3
"Bathrooms were not cleaned, Towels were old and dirty",1
"Hotel was clean, reception was welcoming though not courteous enough. Had to wait a lot for check out. Rooms were well furnished.
Breakfast menu was good and was tasty. All in all a good stay for short visit where you don't have to rely heavily on staff.",3
"I Booked a room with two twins. I tried daily to get the twin beds; I was told they would call me repeatedly. No one called. The room was never vacuumed and they ran out of towels.
When I checked out they charged me taxes even though I paid for the rooms through Expedia. Now I have to be reimbursed for the double room taxes I paid. This stay was difficult.",1
Hotel is Decent. The buffet quality and options has depreciated for the worse.,2
excellent,3
"Efficient, functional hotel. Linen is clean but worn-off. Staff is courteous and helpful but less than elegant. Slight change in the attitude of the property can make this place outstanding!",2
Functional. Not luxurious but quite efficient.,3
"Easy walking distance to Mall with Cinema. Not many restaurants nearby, but fortunately the buffets at the hotel were very nice. No complaints. I would stay there again.",3
"Value: Great deal; 
No",3
"This was an unexpected horrible stay at this hotel. There was drilling going on all day on the roof due to construction work, there was a Bollywood movie set going on all day for three days that made movement in the hotel a pain, the hotel smelt musty and damp and the floors were sticky. The choice of food for non chilli eaters was non existent. I checked out and moved to a much better hotel.",1
Ac only in one mode. Can't adjust temp. House keeping has to improve. Lunch is really limited .curries not enough for provided food. Strange...,3
"The Ambassador Pallava was close to where I had meetings and unexpectedly close to attractions like the national art museum. The property is beginning to show its age, but the food and service were excellent.",3
"I always stay here during my visits to Chennai and did so this time too.
All the staff from the door man, reception, concierge, house keeping, restaurant to the gym were extremely friendly and courteous and made me feel at home. as usual. The location was very convenient to get to all the places i had work at.",3
Average,2
"It was good
Very friendly staff at the check in and at the restuarants",3
Breakfast service was Dhaba Style. Lacked sophistication and style. Not worth the price.,2
"Overall value for money.
Was surprised the room was big for the price I paid",3
"Location of The Ambassador Pallava is excellent, Rooms are very clean and excellent room service. Food is very good and hygienic. Friendly Staff. Travel and Tour information and help is available at Travel Desk. Banks and Hotels are nearby. I strongly Recommend.",3
"I have travelled to most of the state in India and few countries abroad. To be very frank it is the best hotel according to me. The feeling of comfort and safety, a homely atmost here. Stay once and experience.",3
"Very nice this hotel is near my home and I told my friend they stay in this hotel. Me also coming next time also this hotel, service is very nice. I applied many times in this hotel this hotel location is very good.",3
"Though it was a short stay the overall experience was good. The AC wasn't effective, especially for people coming from Bangalore. Breakfast could have been better. All the staff were courteous. Can't do much about the ambience, couldn't go for morning walk.",3
"It's located at nice place. Rooms are good but food is not that good and it is too costly too. Minimum things required in bathroom are not given. Toothpaste, brush and having kit is not given. They should have it.",3
"The hotel is located in an ideal location, service is good. 24 hours coffee shop is nice. Stayed in 5th floor Rooms are good spacious.. All the basic requirements are available.. The pool is nice and huge.",3
"The facilities are good. Value for money. TV has all channels in most languages. Room was clean and neat. Refrigerator working. Water kettle did not have auto cut off. AC was good. The bad thing was the restaurant for lunch and dinner, the buffet was overpriced, food was not great and was cold. The complimentary breakfast was good.",3
"The location of the hotel is nice but the ambience is not good. They have to concentrate and the lift is not working by god's grace we escaped otherwise we would have trapped. They have to maintain and the breakfast is also not nice, they have to improve.",2
It was pleasant stay at Hotel Ambassador Pallava Chennai.. Good location and good service.. Breakfast was good.. Recommended for travellers with family or official purpose. This property is not far from railway station or bus station...,3
"It's good and clean hotel and happy to stay here. Will suggest other to stay here and see the happiness of this hotel location, service and facilities.. It will be liked so much that a person wanna stay once again. Its good to stay with family too, I had stayed single but if I come back again here will be staying here only.",3
Ambience and hospitality is good. Interiors are good like any heritage hotel. Located in very convenient place to move around the city. People are good and ready to serve you as possible. But need maintenance of the bathrooms.,3
The location and all amenities are good but nearby hotels are more good and value for money. The hotel is old and had a rustic smell. Nearby good EA mall. Breakfast served was good. Stayed for a day only and then shifted to nearby good hotel.,2
"Breakfast buffet is very average. Hotel and rooms has that very old look. It does not have that glamour look it had 30 years ago, when I stayed here last but at the rate I got my room on MMT and the location of the hotel... It was worth the money.",3
AC does not work in the hotel as it is a very old AC and beyond repair I guess. TV is also the old box styles TV with limited channels. All other facilities are good and service also is good. The location is a great advantage. Old style 4 star property.,3
"Pretty average stay, Location and all was fine but then, booked the same basis reviews, that prove to be exaggerated! Checked in late night at around 11. 30 PM, ordered Dinner, it took almost 1 hour for delivery and the dish was not the one that was ordered. WiFi never worked. Breakfast average. Overall, if you are willing to compromise on certain aspects, I would say Value for Money.",3
"Stay was comfortable. Its an old property and has a vintage feel to it. Staff is friendly and efficient. Pool is incredibly crowded, mainly kids, maybe due to vacation time.",3
"Although an old hotel with dated decor it is well maintained and the staff were courteous.
The food was good and the room was fine. We just stayed for a night but I would certainly reccommend this as a value for money hotel",3
Got a good deal over the long weekend . Otherwise the rates are pretty much high. Clean rooms and the staff has been very helpful .,3
The staff at Asiana Place were really helpful! They were very accommodating and courteous and ensured our every needs were met. The rooms were well maintained and their breakfast spread was pretty decent. I enjoyed my stay at Asiana Place!,3
"Let's see:
Expedia booking didn't come thru so had to get it by calling, etc Overall hotel is poor, lack of good facilities, etc
Restaurant is not good.
Not to mention the cockroach that was running in Biryani rice in dinner buffet
I planned to stay for 3 days, got out on first.
It is in such an excellent location and could be a great place to host corporate visitors but the place is just not good",1
A decent hotel and the quality and service of the hotel is better. I stayed for one day. I would recommend this place for the people who would worry about the Taramani traffic since it is in the center you don't have to worry about the traffic. On the whole a decent hotel. I would give 3.5/5.,3
"Hotel Asiana Place in Ascendas IT Park was an excellent experience. Very clean, excellent service and excellent food quality. Few negative points: There is no signboard of hotel outside, even if you pass it you will not come know there is hotel. In the locality there is no other restaurant if you want to dine out. Only option would be Ascenda's food court. This hotel is good for visitors of Ascendas IT park.",3
"The location is absolutely fantastic beyond my understanding. Gave me a relaxed experience due to less connectivity of Mobile service, good ambience. Neat & tidy Rooms with approachable and polite staff. Food was good & tasty even. Quite and calm place to relax in between busy scheldule - lovely place to relax not feeling away from home.",3
"Stay for 15 days in this hotel, located inside Ascendas IT park. Comfort level and services are on the best. In breakfast they have limited options but whatever they have taste good. Hotel is having one in house lounge as well entry for guest staying in hotel is free.",3
"The outlook and the facilities of the hotel are good. Highly recommended for business trips. Clean rooms, good food and total value for money. The location of the hotel could have been better (for someone who was visiting Chennai for vacation getaway or beaches.",3
"It was a nice hotel and value for money. Nice space, good ambiance, good breakfast and good service. You will definitely like this hotel. It was nice hotel value for money. Nice space, good ambiance, good breakfast, service is very good. You will definitely like this hotel.",3
"Quick check-in, clean room, quiet - away from major streets, decent breakfast and a not happening bar. I tried the dinner buffet and it is great value for money. The South Indian fare for breakfast - like methu vada and dosa is outstanding. 

Service is efficient and polite.",3
"Found from makemytrip, the hotel located at the IP Park, the park is beautiful. The outlook and facilities are good, WiFi signal is not so good. The breakfast is not so perfect but it is good. The gym is not so good. Service is good but need to improve, totally, it is a little expensive but it is recommended if you want to find a hotel in the IT Park.",3
Chennai is a good place to stay. Only issue is for food for vegetarian for North Indian. Good place for sight seeing. Crocodile park is the good place to visit. You can also go for boating. Ocean beach can be a place for enjoyment. Hotel has limited food option.,2
"The location of the hotel Asiana Palace is very good in the midst of the Ascendas IT Park. The ambiance is also good. The room service is OK but, not very good. The people are good but, take time to serve. The view from the room is also very good. Very good hotel for business purpose visit.",3
"A nice hotel to stay, comparatively spacious rooms at reasonable cost. Located near the IT corridor. Good food and good service, courteous staff. Hotel room is very well-maintained with good amenities. Lavish and widespread breakfast and dinner. Free Wi-Fi. I found, the staff are attentive and helpful. Nice and comfortable hotel.

"One of the best place near by OMR road and great environment. Excellent room services, food taste was too good, rooms are very well-furnished and are in excellent condition. We have a wonderful parking area too. As the hotel is located in Ascendas IT Park, it is much suitable for corporate guys.",3
"One of the best places nearby OMR road, and great environment. Good place and room services, food taste was good, rooms are in excellent condition, and we have a wonderful parking area near the entrance, on time delivery of foods and services makes me to feel great to stay there for more hours.",3
"Cold reception. Unfriendly and unreliable staff. Worst restaurant and in-room dining experience. Very poor food quality. Desolate location. A very 'plastic' feel to the entire features of common areas, rooms and restaurant. Will never recommend this place to anyone I know.",1
"Asiana Place is an hotel setup built into a multistory commercial building , you would feel that in the design of the hotel and placement of its room in both interiors and exteriors, Nothing great about the typical .. a typical business travelers hotel where all you would be looking for a breakfast , gym , dinner and good night sleep. Its place inside a commercial complex so would not make sense for a family stay .. thanks",2
"We liked the room, the cleanliness, extra bed for third person, size of the bed, restaurant on the 1st floor, staff, location, price/rate. I'll choose or recommend to my friends for sure.",3
"It was a pleasant stay, only one challenge is Wi-Fi is horrible. Cleanliness and services are good. There is no landmark to reach this hotel.",3
Nice business hotel and very reasonable. Centrally located on a quiet street.,3
Nice air conditioning..good bathroom and a accessible location makes it a nice peaceful stay,3
Facilities & Room services are Below Average. Man power are very less. Room service are Soo much of time consuming. Network issues. WiFi not working properly,3
"Very feasible location for stay near German consulate Chennai, quiet comfortable with the room. Don't find any good food restaurants nearby for food. Value for money booked via MMT. Breakfast included is okay, not too good.",3
"The area where the hotel is located is best one, it is the exact place where Google show you unlike misleading to other locations. I arrived at night, the staff were good but the room where like smelly and not clean. The wardrobe was full of matchbox and the room smelled like cigarette. The reconditioning system didn't work as I thought. Overall experience was average.",2
"Very good location in are R A Puram, Chennai. Deluxe room was clean and spacious. Complimentary breakfast was okay, lunch was good. Service from the hotel staff was average, receptionists should be more responsive to guests. Overall, good hotel at a decent price.",3
Nice staff. But the rooms were not cleaned daily. The TV did not work properly. The common areas were not clean. This hotel covered the basics. It is good value for the money.,2
"I have been staying here for quite some time having made four visits in the last 2 months. The facilities are absolutely great considering the price. All in all, a very satisfying experience and would strongly recommend the same to freinds",3
"The hotel room is clean, tidy. This place is centrally located. This place has good service and would suggest to one and all for a stay out here. Good, clean and cozy",3
Best place to stay at a very decent price.. Room was very clean and had all the needed facilities. But some renovation work was happening which made our stay a bit unpleasant. Have to force them to stop it.,3
"The hotel was decent, in a very good location. The day we arrived there was loud drilling noise as there was some renovation happening. We were not aware of this. We complained and then an hour later, action was taken. Not spectacular, but definitely an option worth considering for a short stay (especially if available on offer).",3
I don't refer anybody No cleaning no food reception girls very worst behaviour,3
"Overall experience is good. Nice rooms. Some disturbances due to work in progress but it's temporary. Peaceful Residential area. Value for money. Nice connectivity of roads. Refill in room is not regular,,, like water, tea/coffee, etc. If you ask they will do it. Overall experience is very good nice breakfast too. You should try this. Very good experiance.",3
"A good hotel, provides value for the money paid. The rooms were clean and nice. Simple and nice breakfast. The only problem I had was in the bathroom. The wash basin was leaking and water was flowing in the floor while using the basin.",2
The receptionist was badly drugged. Another man was lying on the sofa with his hand in his pants. The property is dingy. One if the worst mistake of my life to book with Treebo. Request everyone not to stay with any treebo property.,3
"Newly done rooms, clean wall and floors. Bed sheets were not changed after previous guest checked out. They could have cleaned it at least. Bathroom also was not cleaned properly. Breakfast was good. I will go again as it is close to office, and value for.the money paid.",2
"Very clean, very well maintained, service and hospitality were good. The complimentary breakfast included was also very good to meet requirements of all kinds. It is also located at prime area, convenient to travel around and it was a pleasant stay.",3
"Comfort and cozy room. However, did not like the AC setup with the air blowing at just one direction of bed. Guess it's a design flaw. Size of room is good for one person.",3
Room was good but staff are ok ok. Service was poor. They did not even provide water.,1
"Stayed here during my 2day official trip in Chennai. Rooms are a bit small but, extremely neat and clean having all the basic amenities. Located at a prime location with key places like Adyar and Santhome nearby. Breakfast is good with sufficient options though mostly South Indian. Best part is its basement pub, which attracts a lot of local crowd and plays some good music for one to chill out. Overall a nice place to stay at a decent price",3
"It was totally a good experience to stay in your hotel. And memorable moments also there. All the services are somewhat better and nice. There is also available facilities like TV, AC. So totally it was a good nice and marvellous amazing and awesome. So the things are going to be like that only. Hence it was a better experience to narrate that.",2
"The hotel is very nice, grand and service impeccable. My room was up on one of the higher floors, but unfortunately the view was not that great (facing courtyard and opposite side of the building). The room itself was clean, nicely furnished and comfortable. Loved to have such a place to stay!",3
It's amazing and I got so many benefits from this. They handle us very smooth. And the hotel appearance is very good and the members are like good participants. Their method of serving is very different from all of the Indian hotels. I think they are give complete approach to us.,3
Very comfortable stay. Staff vert helpful and food superb,3
"Visited Chennai for one night and had a great experience at My Fortune. Great customer service, good food and luxurious living accommodation. Overall, amazing experience!",3
A great experience from check in to check out. Very good food and wonderful service.,3
"Hotel is good. But they do not have free airport pickup and charge very high amount for airport pickup / drop.
Wi-fi charge is abnormally high.
They do not accept payment by e-wallet. Only by cash or credit card.Due to this, making payment was somewhat inconvenient.",3
It was amazing & smooth,3
Excellent for value of money. Staff of the hotel was prompt on their service either I order in mid night then also they provided the thing I don't like in the hotel was I asked the ice bucket in night and the reply was that we have no ice.,3
Except free WiFi the hotel hosts nice rooms tidy and cozy. The staff is very polite. Breakfast was delicious with good variety and prompt service. Stay was pleasant and will highly recommend it for a personal or family stay.,3
"Very close to where I needed to be, so it's the best location for me. Service at breakfast was outstanding. Room service isn't super prompt. In general, the staff are exceptional. The key card has challenges working - maybe gets demagnetised easily. Did not get a chance to use any of the facilities at the hotel this time.",3
Stayed in the hotel for 2 days... It is a decent property with very humble and courteous staff. Food was nice.. The room was nice and clean with all modern amenities. The location of the Hotel is very nice and easily approachable.,3
"It is an old hotel but has been sufficiently renovated. It is very well-located and has service is outstanding. The staff is very well trained. The buffet breakfast is quite elaborate and very good. Of one has time, it is good to enjoy it leisurely before starting for the day. Did not try the other restaurants but am sure the service should be good.",3
The hotel which is the ertswhile Chola Sheraton is centrally located and worked well for me. What I like is the fact that the rooms are large (specially the Executive Club room). The hotel could improve its service though!!!,3
Rooms are very clean and very spacious. The building is old but maintained well. Overall it was a nice experience. Manager was very courteous. Food was good. Facilities provided to the accompanying drivers was not satisfactory.,3
Little improvement on Food and food house,3
. Didi right,3
"Over all excellent and pricing too. It's in the Heart of the city. Well connectivity to all leading areas, malls, theatres, Hospital, and everything. Surrounded by Posh residential colonies like Poes Gardens. Marina Beach is just a walkable distance from the hotel.",3
"Lovely place, lovely staff... Lovely stay. The food was good, expensive though. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was extremely comfortable and clean. Service for towels, cleaning etc extremely efficient.",3
Conversation was not that much,3
.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,3
"My stay at the hotel was good as far as location is concerned. What I feel was that there should be reorganization needed at the reception area. There should be good ample seating facility available for the just arrived customers. Pool side, though small area, may be opened for customer which wasn't at my stay. It must not be kept for show piece rather it should be allowed for users i.e guests. Beside this, the service and food were very good.",3
I know this hotel 33 years when I landed in Chennai in 1982. Formerly known as Chola Sheraton. Repeated stay. Quick check-in process and awarded upgraded room. Excellent service. Room was very comfortable and had pleasant stay. Good breakfast spread and tasty. Value you for money.,3

"This is a pure business hotel for those visiting any of the companies located nearby. Good rooms, good gym facilities including a nice pool, excellent roomservice food which is important since there is __nothing__ in the neighbourhood.",3
"Hotel is rather new so everything was in tip top condition. What is outstanding though is the service. Hotel staff (be in at the front desk or at the restaurants) are attentive and observant down to the details. Even though I had checked out in the morning, I was offered a room to shower and freshen up when I returned in the evening to collect my luggages, so that I could take my flight back in comfort. Excellent thoughtfulness!",3
Excellent location near airport with great service. Room was good with all facility. Great value for money. Food was good. Far from main attraction of city but very wall connected. Taxi is easily available.,3
Good number of options at breakfast but they didn't change much on day 2. Excellent place to stay. Very courteous staff. Well-maintained. Proximity to the airport is a major plus. Airport shuttle was a big bonus.,3
Good facilities and very courteous staff. Service was also excellent and you are made very comfortable. Excellent location close to the airport and easily accessible. Only problem faced was that the fridge was not keeping things cool and it was the same case in the main kitchen also.,3

"Room was really great. Food is fantastic. Room was in perfect condition at the time of check-in. Airport pickup was very smooth, friendly chauffeur. While I was been dropped back in Airport chauffeur asked me whether I have taken my mobile flight tickets if I have left in the car by mistake. Stay is very pleasant and looking forward to come back again on my next trip.",3
Very good and friendly staff who take good care of you. Excellent service wish there was atleast one restaurant to add to the choice. Although cannot complain on the food at all which too was very good.,3

I had visited this hotel with my family for holiday trip. The location of the hotel was good. There was no activity arranged by the hotel.,3
The hotel was at the apt location and very convenient. The Check-in and check-out process was smooth and easy. Their service was prompt and food was excellent. Room were nice and big with all needed facilities. It's a great hotel and prices are also within budget. Well maintained.,3
"I think Hotel needs facelift because when you enter the room One sense like creepy oldies smell, I think better this hotel needs facelift, and in service part they should focus on listening to customers, the best I can wish them a best of luck for future.",2
"Excellent stay in Chennai Abu sarovar portiko. Service very good, breakfast excellent, No of variety Indian, western. Free WiFi, hot and cold water every time, allowed for one or two hours late check out.",3
Complementary breakfast is not tasty. Only masala dosa was tasty and rest food served is average. Room size is small as compared to pics shown. Service is very good. Odour of hand wash was yukkk. TV size is very small given in room.,3
No room amenities.. Poor cleanliness and construction going on... Got amenities only after a strong complaint.. Price is high and amenities very poor compared to other hotels of similar category... Not recommended.,2

Toilet soap is not provided in this hotel. It is dimly lighted place. Very poor room service. I wanted to stay in a 5 star hotel. It looks I did mistake. I had ordered peanut masala and it was stale.,3
Maintenance of shower etc not up to the mark. Room with broken hand shower given without rectifying the same. (Room No 327 on 16/07/2016) which was discovered in the morning. Otherwise ok. Well maintained restaurant though service is slow. Needs to improve.,3
Hotel is totally renovated. Value for money. Rooms are spacious. They accept early check inn subject to availability. Check in and check out very efficient. Lot of savings when booked through makemytrip.,3

The worst hotel ever. The hotel rooms are worth only for 1000 bucks..the food was the worst part of all.. the morning breakfast...the most terrible thing I ever ate in my life. I will never book that hotel again. Not at all worth for money.,1
"Hotel is decently priced and is not far away from ammenities.

.Average neatness .Required towels etc were not readily available .,2
"The room were nice and clean on arrival, but the A/C was not cooling, TV was not working, WIFI was a struggle to get connected to. Once these problems were resovled, the stay was relatively pleasant.
Food choices are less. Need to expand more.
Also, parking space needs to be expanded. Highly unorganized parking cost me one whole evening plan as I had some other untracked guest's car parked in front of mine.",2
"Location is ok but hard to find, room was average but I think that you wouldn't expect anything better at this price.",2
"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights from 25-27 Jan 2017. It was an awful experience. Rooms were dingy, no fresh air experience. Beds were not good, safe lockers not working, no coffee tea maker as advertised, no good bathroom accessories like shower gels, not even foot mats... Breakfast was so horrible that we skipped it the second day. Not at all a 3 * hotel.. Over all a really bad experience",1
Very good worth staying service good...............,3
Satisfied,3
The hotel is located in a quite & secluded lane in a nice neighborhood. Good value for money.,3
"Good hotel, booked it through Oyo rooms & had requested for an early check-in but the folks did not get that request and ended up paying extra, apart from that the hotel was quite good, decent rooms and very good locality. Quite perfect for folks coming to Chennai for their US visas as it's quite close to the processing centre & embassy(About 2kms). All in all a good stay and neat rooms with decent food options nearby!",3
I was on a business trip to Chennai and was for the first time visit I found my stay very comfortable and overall experience was awesome! Staff was timely handling the service and housekeeping was good. Meal was awesome and it was hot and tasty!! I recommend to make your stay best and comfortable. Also the pool was big enough.

Stupendous services. I am definitely going to come back to this place.,3

"Good hotel. Went with my family. Room was very good with good view, was very neat and clean. The bathroom and Air Conditioning needs attention. Food was very good both in room service which was quick and also in restaurant.",3
"Our room was located directly above the outside restaurant which played loud music late into the night keeping us awake. The music was so loud that our room was shaking. Everything else was fine but the reason you get a hotel is to rest, and the excessively loud music made it impossible to sleep.",2
Bathroom was sticking drainage smell asked for spegetii with olive which was not served after complain got it exchanged but not upto the mark n upon check in surprise was spoiled as reception said cnt allow localites Ms Anita never reverted back on my questions one day before check in I asked her thanks to manger of Fo who atleat allowed us to stay m not localite but ramada is knwn peoperty in India should not create such a kind of regulations,1
"Staff is slow but polite and cooperative. Evening dinner not good choices. Nearby restaurants not easily reachable. Talke local teansportation after one block, when they see you walking out of Hotel your charges will double. Do bargain for local transportation, give them 60-75% of what they ask. Over all good experiance. I do recommend hotel if you dont spend too much time in room.",3

Staff were always friendly and helpful
The hotel was located near to most places and not too far to International Airport

Good hotel,3

"Excellent stay. Friendly, courteous, professional staff. Outstanding breakfast! This will be my place of choice on my next trip to Chennai.",3
The room was comfortable & location of Hotel is excellent. However the service is pathetic and annoying...staff needs a lot of training of understsnding & helping guests.,2
Location so so . Traffic was bad. Second time stay in this hotel and food is always the same at breakfast table. Sad thing is no room slipper provided . I was given a room near the life which is noisy at night .,2
Great hotel at a perfect location. Comfortable stay for a day.. will stay again at this place .,3
The best of the best.... excellent service.... top notch... .,3
Hotel staff are terrible and their policies. Everything you need to pay over priced. May be the owner trying to recover his renovation cost fast from guests. Pls read carefully before booking/checking this hotel. They will empty your wallet.,1
Recently renovated and clean room. Spacious and comfortable beds. Fantastic bathrooms. Overall we had an amazing stay.,3
The hotel rooms are very clean and hygienic.The breakfast buffet is really good.,3
Stay was very comfortable. Staff were friendly and service was professional,3
"The location is very central and the property has been maintained well. I am returning after almost 10 yrs and glad to note this. I had to score a point less, as the breakfast wasn't the freshest best. The inroom service (dinner) was very tasty but rip-off expensive.",3
This is good hotel for business traveler. Hotel is clean. Location is good. Food is good and tasty. The only thing which I did not liked was service which could be exception. They were taking much more time to do any room service. Morning breakfast was awesome. They provide almost every modern facility you expect in a good hotel. Also I feel they should increase their manpower.,3
"I stayed for two days and was extremely happy with the location, service, food and ambience of the hotel. The location is very convenient for business as well as shopping. You will also find lot of eateries around the hotel.",3
Very good hotel in Chennai. I never ever seen this type hotel. I was welcomed by everyone with a great smile and I have enjoyed a lot with their hospitality extended during my stay in the hotel. I suggest every one to stay in this hotel at-least one day to get more and more excitement.,3
"Good room size, cleaning was good but need of room fresheners. Good bed quality. Need more water bottle as complementary. Food price was bit high. Need comb & saving kit, need Mobile charger in rooms in case someone missed to bring. Bath soap is to provided as there were only one soap available in room.",3
Its really value for money. Ambience is good. Food quality is good. Location is in central of Chennai and market area. Its very pleasant stay for us. Lifts are very speedy and superb. Its overall get hotel and value for money. They provided unlimited water bottles and WiFi spew is excellent.. Neat and very clean room as usual.,3

Hotel staff were very friendly during the entire stay.,3
GRT Grand has good location with excellent buffets. If you are lucky you would come across few south actors and actresses as there are frequent parties going on. Would love to stay again. Centrally located within the city.,3
"I was quite fascinated by the decor, proximity of the hotel to nearby markets and places to visit. The breakfast buffet was quite elaborate as well. Overall, it was an amazing stay in the heart of the city. Really enjoyed!!",3
It was an amazing place with very courteous staff. Would have appreciated with a hot water kettle with some tea bags and other accessories in the room. Otherwise the place is really good. I liked the French toast in the breakfast a lot. Go for it!,3

"We were very impressed with the hotel. The excellent food was only surpassed by great service! Very chic and modern. Will definitely come back. All the staff from the greeters to the wait staff were courteous, helpful and willing to put 110% effort.",3
The hotel was located outside of the city. I had visited this hotel for official purpose with my colleagues. The quality of the food was good. The activities were not conducted by the hotel. The construction was going on when I reach the hotel. The varieties of food were provided by the hotel. The overall experience of this hotel was good.,2
"A perfect experience! Clean rooms, professional and attentive staff, beautiful roof top pool area, nice buffet. Would rate this hotel at the top of the mid-range hotel and would most definitely stay there again.",3
Worth the money,3
"Very nice hotel in IT section of Chennai. The one disappointment was mosquitoes in the lobby seating area. I sat in the lobby area talking with an associate one evening and got bitten multiple times, which I didn't expect in a hotel of this quality.",3
"Though it was only an overnight stay -- overall I had a very good experience. The staff is courteous & attentive, and the rooms are nice, new, &comfortable. The breakfast also had a decent spread. Only small area of improvement that I noticed was the level of lighting in the hotel lobby -- it was fairly dark both during the evening as well as morning time. Hotel lobby lighting is usually much brighter!",3
"Excellent hotel, friendly stuff. Warmly recommended. Do not expect, though, that they would have a city map or organized guided tours.",3
amazing I loved it,3
Hotel is really great. Staff should be trained properly so that lesser inconvenience to guests. May be their processes should be fine tuned for convenience of guests,3
"Great helpful staff, good breakfast buffet, comfortable rooms, good view of OMR,",3
"Definitely value for money, breakfast is too good and room service and room facilities are awesome especially the pool which is located on the 10th floor of the building and during evening you can see the sunset and have a wonderful feeling, totally I had a great experience.",3
"I am basically travelling all over india and come to Chennai regularly, usually I stay in Lemon Tree and to be honest, Lemon Tree is not worth that money, so I tried this new hotel which is near my friend's flat, it is quite Clean, fruits are good quality, service is fast and nice. Hotel is full of modern, fashion and comfortable.",3
"Extremely well kept place with courteous staff, great rooms and good spread for breakfast. Arrived late in the night but was welcomed by the night staff and was checked in with no hassle. They also have a good spa and gym facility. The towels and sheets are clean and well kept.",3
We were told to check out maximum you 12 pm and the reason given was room is full booked. Their check in timing is 2 pm. We asked for a smoking rooms but was not provided. No liquor license. Good not great.,2
"Overall okay, good instructor in the gym. Front office staff was pleasant.(Anu). Very convenient location for work. Well maintained in terms of property. Scope of improvement in Night shift - Duty Manager.",3
The hotel I tried for the first time as it was a short stay. The place looks very cosy. The staff at reception were very friendly and very helpful. The hotel is very clean and the room was quite cosy and the service was excellent. I would recommend this hotel. Worth for the money you pay.,3
Overall not value for money... Considering the facilities offered. Breakfast and dinner buffet spread needs improvement.. No Bar is a drawback for people who want to enjoy some drinks... Can do better. Friendly staff. New construction on the OMR.. Fair distance from Airport.,3
"Pros: Prime location, Fantastic interiors, Friendly staff and quick service. Cons: Needs more facilities (only one restaurant was open, rooftop dine and bar was shut down). P. S : I wanted to check-out a little late. The management was kind enough to let me check out by 3. 30pm (regular check-out time is 12pm).",3
Very nice ambience and fantastic rooms.. 1 day WiFi is free and also the entrance of the hotel with a piano is mind blowing.. House keeping is good and the staff are very good and also good response for anything.. It's like my home in Chennai loved it.,3
"The short word to say this hotel is SS (Simply Superb). I think there are totally 9 floors in the hotel, we stayed at the 8th floor. The dedication of the staff makes me high to stay in this hotel. The variety of foods are so good.",3
I went to Chennai for business purposes and stayed there for 2 days. The Hotel is very close to the IT Hub and road side. The ambiance is fantastic and the staff were so friendly for any kind of assistance. Very delicious breakfast and you will get all traditional food. It was too amazing and I recommend.,3
I felt okay at the hotel. May be I had a bad day. AC water was leaking and room floor was having lot of water. It wasted my one hour in the morning and breakfast got delayed. Staff arranged bread omelette for me though.,3
Worst hotel I've ever stayed. Was frustrated with the hotel. Those people found hard to give some drinking water. And moreover the way the front office people did put me in a sick position. Please my advice is not to stay there.,2
"If you need to stay in the OMR area, I would recommend this hotel. Please keep in mind they haven't got their liquor permission yet but they have already advertised for it. The omelette in the breakfast is one of the best I have eaten! The hotel staff is very polite and willing to go the extra mile. They have teething problems as its a new hotel. I hope that they will iron out the little problems with the F&B.",3
First stayed at the newly opened Turyaa Chennai. Very welcoming. Excellent hotel with an awesome staff. Everyone here strives to give a great service. Breakfast buffet was delicious. Would stay here again. Hopefully the same standards are maintained.,3
Nice variety of options in the breakfast buffet. Good gym and pool. Clean and comfortable rooms.,3
My stay coincided with 2 unfortunate incidences: currency exchange problem with rupees and cyclone vardah. The hotel could have capitalized on the currency exchange problem to provide some currency exchange for guests. I would then have some rupees to tip service staff. But hotel did not stand out from other hotels on this front.,3
"It so happened that the day of our departure from Chennai cyclone erupted. The airport was closed, there was neither Internet nor telephone. The hotel staff was quite kind (and most importantly, competent enough that uncommon for India!) to help us with the status of our tickets, which allowed us to fly from congested airport after the disaster had finished.",3
"Very friendly staff, room was very spacious and nicely organized. Perhaps the best organized bathroom facilities that I seen in the last little while.",3
The staff went out of the way to serve us well and were attentive to our needs,3
This hotel is centrally located to the biggest mall in Chennai as well as a short drive to Chennai Internatioinal airport. The staff are all very polite and no request is too large (they even helped me dress in a Saree for a traditional day at our Chennai offices!),3
"Really lovely hotel with pleasant staff. 
Very cool and airy rooms
Great bar with big screen to watch the sports",3
The hotel overall is nice. The reception staff was not welcoming towards us. However all the other staff at the front and hotel overall were friendly.,3
My stay in Westin was a great experience. Staffs were very professional and neat. Food was great apart from too much oil in some indian dishes. Loved my massages. Maybe the spa could reduce the volume of the music as some Chinese music can be loud. Overall I really enjoyed my stay. Kudos to all the staffs who attended to my calls. Wonderful experience. Thanks for making my stay a memorable one.,3
"I am a very seasoned traveller. Bedrooms are getting tired and frayed. I stayed here for 3 days. I ate NOWHERE else and even then took great care selecting food from buffet avoiding uncooked. I still got sick. Could only be from the buffet in the ground floor restaurant, they had closed the Thai restaurant I have used previously. I won't be going back.",1
"Room was damp and had a strong humidity smell. The bed felt moist with dampness made the entire night very uncomfortable. It is important for hotels to have proper dehumidification process given Chennai's weather. On the positive note, the service at the restaurant was quite good.",2
"Budget hotel closer to Appasamy hospital. On busy road, you will hear sound till 10:00 pm after that it's quiet. Near by restaurants are there .",3
Was great! Staff friendly & helpful with good English. Also a lovely spa just upstairs,3
The property is hygenic. The facilities listed are well provided and taken care of. The management is very good in taking care of. M totally satisfied about the property,3
No hot water.wifi limited to lobby. Average cleanliness.,1
"Neat room with clean washroom. Really very good experience I never had anywhere. The hotel was very good for the money paid, Exactly what I need from a hotel. In the future I will recommend your apartment to other people. Thanks for this service to OYO. Please carry on this service.",3
"Very happy stay.
Simple and clean hotel.
Would recommend to friends at this price.",3
A decent budget hotel,2
"This is my second time through oyo and they doing great off course as they have lessened the hotel tariffs almost into half when compared to 2014. The hotel was compact, affordable, modern, courteous staff and calm and peaceful. I am trusting oyo once for all my business visits.",3
"Chennai is a beautiful place to visit, in such a busy city found this peaceful hotel with all comforts, nice beautiful rooms, well-furnished and even well-maintained by the house keeping staff, the hotel staff were also very humble. Nice and big TV with d2h connection, well-maintained wash rooms. There is nice restaurant near by where nice South Indian food is served. So overall had a great experience.",3
"Hotel was neat and clean. Staff were very courteous. Gym was the flip side, lacks very basic equipments. Breakfast buffet was good. Live kitchen was awesome. Located near IT expressway, so no commuting problem.",3
"Hotel is located at the Chennai sipcot entrance, hotel is very calm and located for easy access and very good response from the reception and also, the food provided is very good and if you are a looking for a hotel at sipcot then it's a good choice.",3
The hotel is extremely inflexible and policies don't exhibit the trend expected from multi national chain.. And the staff exhibit a behaviour of that of a one bound by a line showing little or no ingenuity while making decisions for customer requests.. Not impressed..,2
"Good service and good breakfast. Overall, a pleasant stay. Hotel staff were very friendly. Restaurant food was very good. Rooms were clean and tidy. Location is next to Sipcot so it is very convenient. Worth the money.",3
"Everything regarding hotel is fine except room is small, location is good and service is excellent. Hotel staff behaviour is fine, nice for short stay especially for business purpose, book your stay at this hotel and you won't be disappointed.",3
"No worth the money, a basic hotel with 150 square feet room, you cannot even turn in the bathroom. Towels were not clean and they charge extra for even room delivery of items. If you have to invite anybody for a talk there is hardly any place to sit.",1
"No breakfast and no dental kit provided. Waste of money. They really charge high. No shaving kit, no complimentary water bottles provided. Such a worst experience. I don't recommend this hotel to others.",1
I had booked this room by online. There was no delay in check in and checkout in this hotel. The behaviour of the staff’s was friendly. The service was done on time. The room was spacious and clean. All amenities were provided in working condition in the room. The food quality was not good. The bar facility was not available at the hotel. The activity was provided at the hotel. I had visited this hotel for marriage purpose.,2
"I was there for a business trip, hence the location was very close to my office. Its good business budget hotel. The rooms are very good however the washrooms are really small ( i mean really small). Food was okay .. not great veg north Indians. Hospitality is warm and the staff is really good. It has a gym and bar. Stay overall is good. Best for short stay.",3
"We have been travelling across India for business purpose staying in various hotels. But I must say staying in this hotel was the worst of all. Small rooms, no extra facilities. Charging for each and everything without any limit. Will never suggest anyone to opt for this hotel. A sheer pain in the wallet experience.",2
Location is very good just 1 km from TCS Office. Food and drink are costly and quality wise it's average. Housekeeping was good. Front desk was very active and prompt. Airport transfer facility is good. Buffet dinner is very costly compared to other 3 star hotels. It would be good if this hotel is having a SPA.,3
Booked the room for myself and my best friend for a relaxing break. The place is simply amazing! One of the best places I have stayed in so far. You can go for this without a second thought. The awesome and cozy room makes you feel like you never want to leave the place!,3
"Except bathroom size which is standard for IBIS Hotel around the world. All facility is good, had a breakfast in this hotel, it was okay. This hotel is cost effective and economically feasible under 3K INR. Very good option, mostly used by people or relative working in SIPCOT IT Park as there is no sightseeing nearby. It is good for corporate people.",3
I liked the hotel for its pool and ambiance and also the service provided by them. It has a good system of technology with good persons and the food is extremely good with good service. Rooms are very well cleaned by the staff regularly finally a good hotel to stay.,3
The room was extremely cramped up. The bathroom is like that in a tight yacht with a major space crunch. They don't even provide you with the basic toiletry. Staff is courteous. Room service does not have many options and they charge a premium for in room delivery.,2
slow front desk with big attitude problem,1
Good,3
"Pride located in centre of city.It is close to many theatres ,restaurants and malls.Eventhough its an old hotel interior of room and reception are maintained very well.Food quality at restaurant is good.As awhile its a good budget hotel",3
Hotel location is heart of the city. Hotel staff are good and cooperative. We are fully enjoyed at their place.. Food is also good. If they add some toiletry kit than much better. Price are very reasonable. Cleanliness was everywhere. We refer to our friend circle.,3
"Rusted bathrooms, quality not maintained like before. Hair on the bathroom floor and toilet seats. Not worth the money. Only good thing is they allowed late check out since I checked in late at night. Location is great.",2
I stayed at Pride hotel Chennai on 11 & 12 July 2016. Booking was done through makemytrip. Com. Hotel is good. Room was very clean and comfortable. Reception response could have been better. Roof top restaurant was OK. Morning breakfast at Cafe Treat was really good. Overall comfortable stay.,3
"Good locality, rooms were good but food was pathetic. Seen mosquitoes, flies and some other small insects were taking breakfast along with us. Seen cockroach in the dining. Otherwise it was a nice stay. If you plan to stay, better plan to have your food outside.",3
"It was really a good hotel to stay with family and its valuable property for money. Except the massage service all others are fine. Bar at the first floor looks good, price slightly on the higher side. Pool was little small. Otherwise there is no much disadvantages there.",3
"It was a good experience staying in The Pride hotel, Chennai. Breakfast was very nice and staff was helpful. I wish the massage center is kept open till 10. 00 pm for those arriving late in the hotel after hectic day. Lift size was too small and could take just 2-3 guest comfortably, without luggage.",3
The Pride is a good business class hotel in Chennai just 3km from Chennai central station. The reception and overall staff is very warm and check in process is very fast. Food is excellent and complimentary breakfast has lots of variety. A good business hotel in Chennai.,3
An OK experience....room service was expensive ...breakfast can be laid out better...,2
Clean and safe. WiFi was somehow not working the entire 3 days I was there. Overall. I'd recommend it to others as well. Location is good as it is on the main road itself and it is easy to move around from here.,3
Pride The,2
Rooms are stinky as well as corridor. As soon you enter the elevator that pungent smell remains till you come out of hotel. The wooden furniture & carpet are too old and probably need to be replaced. Location wise it is good and service wise response is slow. Behaviour of staff is good.,2
Bathroom is very small in the deluxe room which does not hold good for the price paid. Even plug points & extra bed are all obsolete and not user friendly. Staff are OK. Over all higher price by 20% for the amenities provided. Food is OK not great. Needs improvement,2
"It was a good stay and the rooms are good. Breakfast is good and centrally located for easy mobility. Room keys are not working, may be time to replace the system. Other facilities like gym and pool are under maintenance as per the management. On the whole it was a fine short business stay.",3
"It was good and nice stay, I enjoyed. It's centrally located, easy to go to other places. Room is good and the service guys are really helpful. I had a very good stay there. Breakfast spread is really good.",3
For official visit it is perfect for location but number of facilities are not available like pool and gym remains under maintenance. Rooms are good. Hospitality is also good. Ambiance is not at par with other Pride Group hotels but can be comparable.,3
I had a bad time because the wifi was not working. I needed to some important an urgent work. Repeated complaints to the reception staff got me nothing but false reassurance! The management need to really pull up their socks and hire some decent staff or at least educate their staff regarding how to help customers. Also false promises like free wifi should not be made.,2
"rooms are very small , bathroom even more worst",2
"Hospitality is maintained very well, rooms r spacious, washroom are bit conjusted, breakfast was good, buffet at puran dhaba very tasty. Staff always to help.",3
"Excellent hotel in chennai. And the staff are really good and they were able to allow an early check-in and late check-out. everything was excellent except for the bar which was horrible and not well stocked, bar tender had no knowledge bout drinks. But the others things made up for it.
This is an awesome hotel",3
Nice stay at pride as it was convenient to travel to US consulate for two days and i have got my US visa on time. I really appreciate because they helped me in early check in at 7.00 am and upgraded me to a better luxury room as i had some issue with toilet. But they all extended their support and had good experience.,3
"Took an hour to find this hotel. It is away from the main street, but loved the view from our room. We arrived around 10pm after almost 8 hours of drive from Chennai. All we wanted was a good, hot shower but to our dismay the hot shower was not working. They took 2 hours to get that repaired. The staff were trying their best, but its just that we were so frustrated!",2
"Nothing fantastic about this hotel. Only thing I could think of was the staff at the restaurant. He speaks well and excellent customer service.

Bathroom was small, towels were dirty, toilet bowls were dirty too!

Far from airport.",2
"The air conditioning spits water and the room feels very moist and smells weirdly. The reception staff are not flexible or understanding so, please be very eloquent during your enquiry. The food is expensive and very basic. Internet is charged.",1
decent business hotel but pool not great. dinner on the terrace is nice with great service. service overall was quite good. wish the pool was better and bigger and cleaner. staff is helpful.,2
The man at reception in the morning was most helpful .,2
"We liked the place. Rest room was good, but would like to have availability of tissues and toilet paper also.",3
We were generally happy with our stay in this hotel.,3
Mahalaya Residency is a good option to choose transit passages. It’s very near to the airport plus there's complimentary pickup and drop for the guests that was great. Front office staff are very friendly and as express check in and checkout policy.,3
"Location is dead on. Very near to airport. Airport drop was perfect. Even at 3 in the morning they dropped me at airport. No cribbing or confusion. Coming to cleanliness they can improve. Towels dod not appeal. Bed sheet okay only. But overall, 100% OK for transit stay.",3
Nice location for transit passengers. Efficient pickup and drop service to the airport. Do not expect too much from the room but has excellent value for money. Complimentary breakfast. Washrooms could be improved. Stayed twice and will stay again in the future.,3
"Staff are very professional and helpful. Rooms are neat and clean. Morning breakfast are very tasty. Very near to airport. We have been to temples in kundrathur, Avadi. Value for the money. We had a very good time.",3
"Other than proximity to the airport and the room service, there's nothing to say about this place. Last time we stayed at savera in Chennai which was really good and this one leaves bad memory. A word about room service personnel which is a Plus for them even though the food quality was average.",2
"Perfect stay near airport.. Well occupancy, well clean, neat and perfect stay to go ahead.. With affordable cost and good cleanliness too. Give a try and my experience was most better and satisfied with this.",3
"The hotel location is very close to the airport. The rooms are clean, but little noisy. 
Food is not pricy.",3
"Very good in all front, near to airport and they have pick-up drop facility without any charge. Staff are very good and cooperative. Restaurant /Bar is also very good.. Can be suitable for 1-2 day's. Connectivity to Airport and city is very good.",3
"Hotel is very near to airport. Breakfast was not so good. Food was excellent, Bar is very good but I preferred to chill at room as BAR was very crowded after 7pm. Airport pickup and drop was good even I needed it at 3 am",3
"I always use the Mahalaya when coming back from a trip in the middle of the night. The hotel driver picks you up from the airport in 5 minutes, the rooms are clean and service is great. It is the best airport hotel in Chennai for a reasonable rate. Good value. But you must request a good room: some are much better than others.",3
The hotel is overpriced. The rooms are not clean and the food quality is bad. Stay here only if closeness to Airport is very important to you. Prices are too high for the level of comfort offered. If possible travel to either Guindy or beyond Tambaram for much better rooms.,2
It was a fantastic stay in the hotel. The staff was good and cooperative. The rooms were clean and maintained. The food in the restaurant was good and fresh and nicely served. Moreover it was a good experience.,3
"The room was small, although clean. Friendly staff, who were quite helpful. The restaurant food was reasonable. The toilet accessories were minimal. However, the location is very good. The bed should have a different mattress and it was very uncomfortable.",3
"Non cooperative staff and no service during breakfast, overall no value for money paid. Would not recommend to any friend, would request Makemytrip to not downgrade themselves by taking such hotels into their fold.",1
Hotel does not provide facilities as per three star standards. They have to Improve their quality of services to provide value for money being charged. One feels short changed. The same doesn't provide a comfortable stay which one is looking for.,2
"It was a memorable stay. The staff was very cooperative. Cleanliness was really up to the mark. It is value for money. Services were also prompt and instant. Located very near to the airport, it is a good transit hotel.",3
just two minutes away from airport friendly staff came to pick us from airport 2am good timing,2
Stay was short -- only for one night -- but was very comfortable,3
"Very Bas Hotel. Just nearby Airport. unkind & dirty, Noisy hotel.",1
"Staff were helpful, it is close to the airport. The bathroom fixtures were old, holes in the doors, and could use some renovation and upkeep. It was okay since we just stayed there for a couple of hours before having to take a flight.",2
"Very nice hotel close to the airport. 
Good food in the hotel restaurant. 
Quick check in and out.",3
The hotel staff is friendly but the hotel room comfort is poor.,2
If you are going to Chennai just for shopping then the hotel is far from T. NAGAR .,2
"I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It was an oasis of calm in a frenetic environment of clearing up after the cyclone, dealing with demonetisation and the excitement and crowds of the Chennai test match. Well done India ; a really talented team. The restaurant staff were helpful and friendly, Bappa especially, and the food very good.",3
"Staff was very attentive, from front desk to the housekeeping to the restaurant. Staff was great!",3
Very calm and quite place to live in the busy city,3
the staff became more friendly after the first day. became very willing and helpful.,3
"This is a small neat little hotel with all facility. Excellent management more like the owner has a direct hand in running this property. Rooms, washroom, staff, breakfast bed, linen all five star this Is a excellent property well run.",3
Good hotel in a prime location close to the beach and US consulate. The rooms are neat and the toilets are clean and spacious. The complimentary breakfast they provide has a good spread. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a room in Chennai.,3
"The location is so strategic that it is close to many places you plan to visit. The rooms are very clean and the service is excellent. The best VAS is a free drop to the US consulate. The Spencer's mall, heritage temples, Higginbotham are a must visit places.",3
Room is very extraordinary and very good service. Food is unbelievable and taste in my opinion. Bed and bathroom is very clean and hygienic. In one word my experience is excellent in this hotel.,3
"The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.
if you require a taxi, the hotel staff gets you one and help negotiate a good price.

we enjoyed our stay at the hotel.",3
Been here for my visa interview with family. Stay was cool and decent. Hotel staff was good. I requested for late check out and was arranged with one room while other one had to be checked out due to booking. The restaurant options were not many. We preferred breakfast hot but was cold. Plus point is it is close to US consulate and Chennai VAC.,2
"Had a good stay at the La Woods. The restaurant options were not many, but the location had ample of options nearby. Was very happy with the room, and the stay, including the behaviour of the hotel staff. There are not a whole lot of amenities at the hotel, but if all you are looking for is a good place to rest for the night, while you complete your work during the day, this is a good choice.",3
Hotel is very good and facility also very good and all staff service but hospitality is little poor because no dental kit/no shaving kit. Rest all is good and location also good in hotel food variety is very less.,3
"Excellent service from the staff. Very prompt and responsive. They helped with all queries immediately. Rooms are clean. The breakfast had variety and restaurant also provided good options. The location is ideal for any US consulate work, they even provide free drop. I would recommend to everyone.",3
"Location good, staff very helpful hotel maintained neatly including lobby and other premises, breakfast is good, and other food average. Good for visa purpose stay and cab drop arranged to consulate.",3
"The hotel is really good and worth your stay for the budget, location and food. It is located very close to Express Avenue mall and Spencer plaza and easy to connect to locality of Chennai. It's a stay that not to be missed.",3
"Last week I visited, Chennai for my Visa interview, as I booked this Hotel via online portal - (Make my trip account) the login/logout schedule was quite strict (12 PM -12 PM) format, but thanks for the hotel staff who supported me to the max. Even though the hotel was full, which made my travel very comfortable.",3
Pretty nice and spacious room with modern fittings in bathroom. Hotel is centrally located in walking distance from Express Avenue mall though the street is a little dim lit in night. Breakfast buffet is good and staff is courteous and helpful. Overall definitely value for money hotel!,3
Very clean and king size bedroom at nominal price. Location is also good. Room service and food is good. WiFi facility free and speed is good. Express Avenue and Spencer Plaza (shopping mall) is nearby. Had a great stay.,3
Good and value for money. I stayed for one day on personal trip. And everything shopping to movie eating options everything is very close. Spencer's mall and express avenue are closer one. Breakfast need more options. Almost no north Indian dish is included.,3
"I stayed here for a couple of nights, when I came for an US visa stamping. The room is very clean and service was good too. Location is good too, very near to US consulate. The complimentary breakfast buffet had many selection and was good too. Would definitely come back if need be.",3
"Overall a good stay in La Woods, breakfast was excellent and included in the price. The room was clean and well appointed, no windows in the room though so it can be disorienting. FabIndia and other stores are within walking distance, and staff is helpful when you need directions or a recommendation for a place to go.",2
"Room was not available after reaching there, so they made us to rest in backup room till the actual room is ready. Other than that evreything was fine.",2
"Excellent staff, willing to go out of their way to make your stay great. Can't say enough about them. Good restaurant, clean room.",3
Not worth the rating shown. Service is not good. Room not well maintained. Room are spacious. Illumination of room was very poor. TV Remote not working. Carry good mosquito repalent. Location wise it is excellent who want to stay in near central Chennai.,3
"The location is good as it lies between Central and Egmore. The service is very good. The food is Non Spicy but very tasty. Poor Wi-Fi connectivity. Good Ambience in lobby. However, More cleanliness is desired. In totality good value for budget travellers.",3
Lot of Mosquitoes in the AC room because of the proximity of the Kuvam river. Otherwise the room was clean and toilets were OK. Printing facilities were not good in the hotel when we wanted to take a print out of a business proposal. There is a 50/50 chance I might go there next time.,3
Hotel near by Chennai railway station. Good helping staff. Nice food. Very good AC for the room and all over the hotel. Very good complimentary breakfast with nice atmosphere. Stay is very good in hotel.,3
"Very near to central and Egmore stations, it's value for money, it's worth for the amount, hotel was decent. A approachable to all near places, the food was OK, AC was working properly, Chennai always the climate would be humid kind off, but it was pleasant during my stay.",3
Good facilities. Excellent location. Worth for the payment. Really good restaurant and staff,3
"Good location. Good facilities. Clean and well accessories in the bathroom with provision of towel, soap, shampoo, comb and oil. It's locate nearer to Chennai central having good restaurant with buffet system folding option.",3
It is value for money. Breakfast is good & staff are polite. Very good hotel for people coming & going by train. AC was good. Will definitely stay again if I come by train. Coffee served in room is very average & not hot & don't need so much quantity too.,3
The renovation work going on.. AC was Not good. No LED TVs provided. Hotels with this tariff level normally provide complimentary breakfast. But not here. Restaurant not good. Coffee served in the room was poor. If you are looking forward to move around Chennai city it is a convenient location.,2
"Average thing in this hotel is average, but considering the price for the room, and the room is quite big. It is a hotel you can choose to stay. The location is some good seems it is close to the railway station. However, they have a very good part, their restaurant! The food is so delicious even compared to other expensive restaurant. But you should skip their buffet, and just go for their a-la-carte.",3
Room is not at all clean and sprayed with mosquito chemicals and smells bad. Also they are doing refurbishing the hotel and sounds are irritating and not able to take a sleep at all. Also many times I told them to stop or change the room after one hour stopped that sound by repeated calls only.,1
If you want to stay but you don't know location then go as per Makemytrip. Don't read instructions. Whatever you get is bonus for you. Not satisfied. Don't booked cab from hotel travel desk. They will charge Rs 1150/. Ola/ Uber charge only Rs 300/.,2
Hotel facilities is very good and sarvice is very good and location is very good and restaurants sarvice is very good and food is very good food like and testi and hotel sarvice is very good hotel facilities is very good so hotel is good,3
I had visited this hotel for official trip. I went this hotel by my own vehicle. The hotel was located in the city. The food was nice. The food was expensive. The non-vegetarian food was provided in the hotel. The complimentary breakfast was provided in the hotel. All the amenities were provided in the room. The room was neat and clean. The gym was arranged by the hotel.,3
"Its a nice hotel near to Chennai central.. Awesome that's why I choosed this hotel, the staff are well behaved and helpful. Very near and walkable distance to Chennai central railway station and well decorated reception which gives attraction while entering with peace beauty and fragrance.",3
This hotel continues the fine tradition of Oyo Hotels using old photographs or one of a room that either does not exist or is made to look good just for the advertising. The foyer is like in the pictures but the other pictures?..,1
Everything was average right from the hotel condition to the the room and the bathroom.. The hotel is actually very very old and need renovation badly..,1
poor stay,1
We stayed at this hotel because we needed a place to stay for a 1 a.m. flight. It was clean and the staff got us a cab to the airport at a reasonable price. It was adequate for our needs.,3
Well room was not clean.. too was the bedsheets & bathroom. Disappointing the Room we booked was not the same as we saw while booking thru expedia web. Breakfast 6/10.. Next time will not stay at this hotel. overall hotel stay experience 4/10. :O,1
"Hotel and the room is a bit run down, but the staff and the food were really good. Will definitely consider if there's another trip.",3
"Very friendly staff, nice food, quick checkin. Would love to stay here when I visit India again.",3
"HOTEL IS NOT AT ALL GOOD STANDARD FOR THIS PRICE IT CHARGES. IT IS BIG PROPERTY BUT NOT AT ALL TO THE STANDARD MENTIONED. WIFI WAS NOT AT ALL GOOD. AIR-CONDITIONING WAS NOT GOOD. LOBBY VERY NOISY ,",1
Stayed for one day only Room very comfortable clean and excellent service.Food quality can be improved,3
"Everything about the hotel is great except for the bathroom and the location.

The bathroom was tired and worn with no hot water at times.

The hotel is across from the bus stop so very busy.

It is more used for banquet functions.",1
It's ok for couple of nights. WiFi works. Basic amenities ok.,3
I love my stay there i will always choose the hotel whenever am in Chennai.,3
"A class stay for family. Take it as for food or location wise stay or atmosphere of surrounding yeah, this hotel property is worth to take a chance guys ....",3
Not good... A/c was not working .changed room but still had a weak a/c,2
"The hotel is a little further than I expected (25-30 in taxi). That said I didn't want to pay double to stay at the Hilton and the closer hotels, so for the price I was happy. Room was fine. A little musty and smelled of cigarettes but the AC helped clear it out. Didn't have hot water in th shower. The complimentary breakfast was excellent and the staff was friendly and very helpful. The rooms are quiet so I slept well.",2
The hotel was really nice and it's clean and tidy with all facilities at good. But the way the staff welcomed us was terrible and they didn't even greet properly. Other than that it's a nice hotel to stay.,3
We had a great time during our stay. Food and view from our hotel was great.,3
We loved staying at Leela Palace. Staff were professional in behaviour and friendly as well. It would have been great if the there was access to the balconies.,3
Very excellent service and hotel,3
Right from the entry into the hotel to every detail- there are people who serve you with a smile and with so much patience. Loved every minute of the stay. The breakfast spread was awesome and all the people at the Restaurent were so kind and pro-active to serve us. Thanks for wonderful stay.,3
"We received a very warm welcome, and we were provided privileges well beyond the amenities and terms we had reserved for. The front desk receives special mention from us for this. Thank you for your kindness. Every aspect of our stay either met or exceeded our expectations handsomely. We will be back for a longer stay the next time we are in Chennai.",3
It was absolutely beautiful. Great service.,3
"It is a great property with great fitness facility, amazing staff, comfortable room, outstanding buffet breakfast and reasonably priced afternoon tea. 

Staff like Moses were very attentive, courteous and helpful. We enjoyed our staff and sure to visit again.",3
We planned a unplanned trip to a Leela and we had fantabulous experience at Leela. Food specially is to die for .,3
"We had a delightful time at The Lela in chennai. The hotel building, furnishings and art are lovely. The rooms are large and very comfortable with everything you need. The team members at the concieriege and in the restaurants were very warm and worked hard to ensure we had every need met. The gym is excellent as is the day spa and the pool area was very nice too. We stayed for 3 nights and then came back for another 5. Highly recommend.",3
"Overall hotel is very nice, only they should provide Free WiFi's facility with Room rate",3
"VERY FRIENDLY STAFF IN ALL AREAS, VERY GOOD INDIAN RESTAURANT DOWNSTAIRS...POOL IS GREAT ...ALSO A SHORT WALK AWAY IS SOME AWESOME CHAI WITH THE LOCALS",3
great,2
"Good Service by Staff but Parking wasn't available in Hotel. Had to find a parking outside.
Name of the Hotel is different, pictures are lot different.",1
The stay was good and the attendants are cooperative. we had nice stay for the value paid.,3
TOTAL MESS UP BY OYO,1
Mosquitoes in room and no TV. The big TV subscription expired and morning breakfast was very poor. No towel and blanket. I never suggest this hotel but front office executive is good and friendly. He gave me WiFi password. There are no good hotels near this room to have lunch and dinner.,1
Comfortable n spacious rooms.. Economical.. Good breakfast.. I would definitely visit again..,3
"Not at all satisfied. Worst possible service received. No towel and soap in bathroom. Management is bad as well. Not at all cooperative. Breakfast is bad. TV and air conditioner is not working. Overall, bad.",2
"If you are a traveller and want places to just crash after a tiresome exploring day, this is the best place to go. Very nice concept for backpackers. Good value for money and nice place to stay. Rooms were clean, awesome breakfast was included in the room tariff. Overall good experience! Thank you Oyo Rooms.",2
"Overall good stay, slightly away from main road but walkable Distance to Pondy bazaar, excellent food, good house keeping issue with hot water during peak hours. Surrounded by grocers and main road around 100meters",3
"Hi MMT lovers, This is a great deal I've got through MMT for this hotel. Place is ideal and location is heart. Simply very good hotel to stay with. Rooms are fantastic and very clean. Service is like star category. They extended few hours during our stay. Very gentle and kind.",3
"First of all ideal centrally located in the city, Very good ambience Well trained staff and good hospitality services for every body and every on from restaurant to room service. Clean property. Well maintained Very warm service from every single person personnel Would like to stay again while I be in Chennai and would recommend specially corporate",3
Very good. I used to stay regally this is city centre ease moment to all please good food very good reception clean rooms all staff are very close and friendly they allowing late checkout also they have a Vellat Parking also.,3
Good . .,3
"Nice hotel, good hospitality, clean rooms. Good experience, people welcomed in a good manner.. The service is at best. The atmosphere in hotel is as named Quality Inn. Well maintained and food is enjoyable. You get the best for the money spent. The food is good... Value for the money.",3
Good . .,3
"Though I stayed only for a night, I felt that most of the facilities in the room are now getting old and need replacement. For ex. The toilet closet was leaking all the time. The door latch was old and I nearly hurt my finger. Small small things which needs to be replaced/ repaired. I had stayed in this hotel for 3 months continuously around 12 years back and feel that all the utilities and fittings are the same.",3
"Good experience, people welcomed in a good manner.. The service is at best. The atmosphere in hotel is as named Quality Inn. :) Well maintained and food is enjoyable. You get the best for the money spent. And the location of the hotel is easy accessible to nearby stores.",3
This hotel is worth the money. Courteous staff. Economical. Reasonably good complimentary breakfast. It's located in the heart of Chennai namely T. Nagar. Bang opposite kamarajar's ( the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu memorial house.,3
It a nice hotel to stay in at a good location with nice rooms and a very courteous staff. Food quality is above average but at the same time breakfast buffet was just average. The rooms are clean and at this price it is definitely value for money. I would visit the hotel again.,3
"This was my first stay in this hotel during my recent trip to Chennai. The rooms are ultra spacious and clean, very good restaurants are located nearby, bathrooms are clean, the hotel is value for money if we get discount from travel websites or else other options are also available.",3
I would not recommend this hotel. Nothing is right toilet does not work and the bathroom is very small. Door not locking and the service is not up to the you have already paid. Lunch buffet was pathetic.,1
"I thought the Quality Inn Sabari is maintaining same quality as it was. It is disappointed. The bed-covers and pillows are smelly. Very bad to stay. Some bad odor was coming from the Pillows. :( I wouldn't recommend. However, the service is good. I will not stay there again.",2
"Nice people to stay with, tries to give best of services. Little old hotel, may need a renovation to do even better. Wi-Fi is not that fast and easy to connect. Must improve upon North Indian main course.",3
"I really enjoyed my stay, and the staff were very friendly!",3
Stay was great. Only that the breakfast was the same everyday and quite boring. The staff were very polite and humble and help came as soon as we asked. Would be good if regular customers were given a flexible time to check out as some flights depart in the night and hotel rigid check out time is 12 noon.,3
Overall the hotel facilities were good. Nice location and not far away from Airport.,3
"Booked for my visa interview at the US consulate.
Was not expecting much from the hotel at this price. But it was definitely not bad.
Staff are very courteous and helpful.
I am most happiest about the fact that they agreed to a late checkout for me no questions asked. I just had to tell the manager at the reception during my check in and he happily amended my reservation.
Thanks for a pleasant stay!",3
Great place to stay....feels like home.,3
"It's a value hotel, offering comfortable stay. I still feel that it's a little overpriced for the amenities and the quality of the room. Food is ok. I think the bathrooms can be spruced up a little more. I asked for a late check out which they offered me, so that was good.",2
"Clean and spacious room. Good and tasty breakfast as complimentary. Wifi is bit slow. Food???? Is ordered from outside. Service staff is very good and cooperative. Hotel???? Is situated at very convenient location, 4 min walk to 10 downing street a very prominent pub in T Nagar.",3
"Disillusioned by the photos online..very cramped
Shabby place",1
"The whole hotel is just one floor of the research park. Power kept going off and the wi-fi was flaky at best. Stay tried their best to help but there experience was not good especially considering there price. 

The room was small. Window was tiny and the room service was OK at best. 

The towels were not soft and they gave just one towel?!",2
It is a nice hotel located on the 11th floor of the Tech Park near IIT Madras. The rooms are small but functional. The staff are efficient. The food options in the cafeteria are a little disappointing.,3
A new experience . One can enjoy self-services. Near to beach also. Very good hotel staff.,3
Located on the 11th floor of Tech park. Its 'OK' kind of a hotel. The rooms are well kept. Food was good too. There are many options for food. It has a nice view of the city. The staff were hard working. Overall it's a good hotel. Stayed there for business purpose. Wouldn't mind staying there again. It is highly convenient for those who work in the Tech Park.,3
"Hi

Given the room rates. The hotel is a decent return for your money just for the location. It's proximity to ramanujan IT city is the big plus. The room and facilities are on par for a budget hotel. But definitely clean. The rooms are on the top floor so the lift takes a long time. The staff are friendly. Overall I rate as a 3.5 but only for biz travellers",2
"Food is not so great other than breakfast, centrally located so transport is no problem. Metro rail station very nearby and metro rail can be seen from the hotel. Laundry can spoil your clothes, once spoiled, they hesitate to compensate guests.",2
It was nice hotel which perfectly suits my pocket. Food was really an important thing that makes this hotel very famous. It is nicely built though some mistakes. Luxurious rooms and Air Conditioned makes it too cosy. I love the hotel and want to visit it again in my next holiday. Food was nice and room service was all upto expectation.,3
"Hotel looked quite ordinary and I should say hotel should improve its decoration and overall appearance because it was looking very basic and ordinary. Room was very good in space and it was well maintained had quite good facilities, all appliances were working fine. Room services was timely and food was quite good and very nicely prepared. Considering its good facilities it's a good hotel.",3
"I had a good to stay. It's very nice day I enjoyed and we made a birthday party with my girlfriend. Overall it's nice but need some more freedom. Anyways we enjoyed in Jan. If we get a chance to stay, we try to stay again there. The food is good and the room is also good. Nice safety to stay with your betterhalf and the pay is also reasonable. Front office is also nice. Overall, everything in the hotel is good.",2
I stayed here along with my family and its a good budget hotel located very near to bus terminus. We stayed for sightseeing and food tastes Ok in this hotel. As it is a budget hotel don't expect more from them but the standards of Tata Group are not lost in it. It is located in very convenient place from railway station and bus terminus.,2
"The Ginger Hotel at Chennai is located very near to the corporate hub and IT park. The rooms were clean and service was ok. Overall, I would rate this to be a decent budget hotel for the corporate people and without any hesitation must go for stay if need be.",3
The overall facilities provided by the hotel was good. The Services and the food rendered by the staff of the resort was upto the mark. The Hospitality towards customers is appreciable. The stay at Ginger has given given a better feel of Chennai and has put a thought of revisiting the same location over again.,3
You get what you pay for . Good value. Proximity to some it companies,3
"A good hotel and a little bit expensive for the facilities they claim so. Rooms are cramped and we get mugs and buckets to take bath only on request. Housekeeping needs to pay more attention on cleanliness and safety. Parking is not convenient either. Food is pathetic, and we had to go out for food each time.",2
"Stayed in this hotel in the month of Nov 2013. Rooms were neat and clean, well located, near to big software parks. Co-operative staffs, good modern facility like WiFi. Rooms are small. But food is good and is value for money. Rates are justified as per the location.",3
Very nice stay,3
Too far from town.,1
"Hotel was nice, the staff was excellent and the service was great, BUT there was heavy construction going in right next to the hotel building. The construction noise was annoying till late night and early morning.",2
Decent affordable and safe place if you need an inexpensive place to sleep.,2
"Good location , clean , insufficient staff, toilets ventilation is poor .",2
"The hotel is at a convenient location and the rooms are pretty spacious and comfortable, the staff is courteous too. But the rooms have a terrible cockroach infestation, they were in the cupboard, bathroom, on the bed and tables. When we informed the staff, they changed our room, but the new room wasn't any different. They definitely need to get pest control and fumigation done. The buffet breakfast spread is good, otherwise the food is average.",1
"We had a good stay at this hotel. We chose this hotel because it is at walking distance of train station Chennai Egmore. The area around the hotel is lifely. Inside the hotel it is quiet. The room was good and we liked the breakfast, although there were only a few continental options.",3
"A economical stay at heart of chennai Egmore. Food is good, but looks for me a bit expensive to the quantity and taste.",2
"Hotel was decent enough although room was disappointing compared with the lobby and restaurant area. The bar and staff in the basement was good and hotel was in a convenient location. We selected a different hotel when we came back to Chennai mainly because of the reception staff who didn't want to help us get some change for the tuk tuk when we arrived, or help us with onward transportation.",2
it was very comfortable an enjoyed.,3
The room allotted to me was neat and clean. The service provided was not much satisfactory. Complimentary breakfast was provided by the hotel. There were no activities organized by the hotel. The surrounding of the hotel was calm and peace. I would like to recommend this hotel to others.,2
"My experience about the hotel was good, I am travelling alone for business purpose. The room service is good, room are very clean and hygiene own restaurant too. The staff are good and it's behaviour with customer is very nice and they served free breakfast and news papaer also.",2
This hotel is located very near to the Chennai central and is easily accessible. The ambiance of the hotel is good and the rooms are clean. Although the service is good. They need some improvement on this area. The food is good. The reception area has to air conditioned centrally since the climate is hot.,3
"Its a very good hotel near to central station. There service food and everything is excellent, responsible travel desk front office. Very good hospitality in treating guests. Whenever I visit Chennai I used to stay in hotel due to the hospitality of the staff. Last five years continuously I am staying in this hotel only.",3
"Very clean, helpful staff, near the airport and good value for money. Nice breakfast served, a lot of security is installed for making sure of complete security of the visitors. Room service was prompt to attend to our needs and helped us pack our breakfast early morning when we were leaving. And the main thing is the location is very much convenient to commercial areas & the central railway station.",3
"Totally satisfied with the service provided by the staff. Talking about the food, it awesome especially the north Indian. It's situated in the central part of Chennai. It's cheap and affordable for average people. Staff are cooperative and well behaved with their customers. Rooms are neat and clean and service provided by the housekeeping is not too bad. Overall talking about hotel, I would recommend for travellers to opt this hotel for staying.",3
"Best for travelers due to the proximity to the Central Railway Station and the famous old Moore Market of the city. Breakfast (Complimentary - Buffet) was really worth going to the restaurant for. AC works but the rest of the room, spacious though, is budget class.",2
The destination of this hotel is very nice. The building is very wonderful. Actually I love that place and the room service was good. Bathroom are neat. When I was stayed in that hotel I loved those food. Surrounding location was good. I thank to all of us who served me.,3
small was very small. limited channels in tv of 40. no bearkfast.,1
Horrible,1
"My parents and aunt stayed for a couple of nights. The room was comfortable after they changed rooms due to rattling fans and broken ac!. The restaurant is a mixed one, so staunch vegetarians would want to eat out.",2
"Overall service is good. Awsome location Must visit.. .................................................gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood :-)!!!!!!!!??!????????????????,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ..........",3
"Stay is good, pleasant and food also not bad. Very near to central railway station.",3
"Since the advance reservations are made, checking in is swift and pleasant.Rooms are cozy but enough to relax after day sight seeing.a nice place to stay with family within budget limits.",3
"Clean, comfortable and convenient location",3
Average hotel. Preferred because of close proximity for shopping.,2
"Food was not good
Cleanliness should be improved
No linen in the bathroom
DTH quality was poor
Hotel ambience was dull.",1
Towels are not provided in the room for this kind of standard hotel. I have to call room service. The worst part is the towels are like rat bitten at the edges. Very poor.,2
good stay and good value,3
"Myself and my wife enjoyed our stay very well. As a matter of fact, we regularly visit Chennai in middle of Jan every year and we make it a point to stay in this hotel always. Good staff, good service and good location. .",3
It's a very good stay. Decent hotel. Busy location. Everything is good about the stay. It's a value for money in such a busy location. Walkable distance from Mambalam station. I strongly recommend this hotel.,3
"Location of the hotel was ideal for our business purpose. Room was also OK. However, there was always a lingering foul smell in the room particularly during the evening and night. In spite of giving complaint, it was not resolved. Service was okay, but required repeated calls. For calling the hotel as Grand, they have to revamp the AC services and other utilities in more specialised way. Other aspects have been graded appropriately as above.",3
"Booked a room for 3 guests and on arrival was given a double bedroom that is too small to put an extra bed anywhere. Hotel staff mentioned this is the size of their rooms and they will remove chairs and table to accommodate extra bed. Hotel manager finally offered a bigger room, if I'm willing to pay extra Rs. 1000. Room was clean though and housekeeping was good. But breakfast as usual was very poor.",3
Good location. Courteous staff. Value for money. Good food. Comfortable. Since it is located in the business area it is also convenient for people who do trading business. For religious trips also it is centrally located in the city of Chennai. The spacious reception lawn is also an attraction. Transportation from outside the hotel is convenient.,3
"BKR Grand it was a nice experience, staying in the bkr grand hotel. We were enjoyed in our family friends and relatives all the family members. The stay in hotel, food, facilities, cleanliness, value for money, the room and the location we liked and good enjoyment.",3
"Amenities and facilities are items or services hotels offer for their guests. Everything was very good. Nice experience to our family friends and relatives. In and out of the hotel are very good management, customer service, phone responses also good on the day.",3
"Room service, Reception Hospitality, Cleanliness is very poor. Morning Breakfast quality needs lot of improvement. Rooms are also not clean. Service is also below Average. Housekeeping Dept needs Lot of improvement. In Morning breakfast, some more variety items required.",1
"Amenities and facilities are items or services hotels offer for their guests. Everything was very good. Nice experience to our family friends and relatives. In and out of the hotel are very good management, customer service, phone responses also good on the day.",3
Good hotel at good location. Hotel is situated at famous shopping area in T Nagar. Room are good & clean. Morning breakfast is excellent. The property is well maintained. They have in house separate Veg. Restaurant. Travel desk is also available in lobby.,3
"I just stayed for one night.. I was not able to stay in the room as Bath room was too bad and very bad smell coming from the bathroom... Into the room... Booked for three and I never thought these will provide extra bed on floor.. Very cheap paid 3500, in that case I would have booked two rooms.. Not value for money at all. Only Service was good.",2
"The stay was pleasant, but the facilities that was mentioned in the website was not provided. The welcome breakfast was not given for the reason we came late, whereas it was not informed at the time of Check in about the time till which breakfast will be served. Wifi password was not given. On the whole the service was extremely poor.",2
"High priced small room size, smelly rooms. Good location. Looks great from outside but rooms are not good. Complimentary breakfast is only for a few items, charges for other items. Not good as per the price you pay for the room.",1
Wi-fi not smooth .. Cleaning may be improved. Also compliment breakfast must be added with some more variety .. Replacement of bed sheet must be atleast alternative days.,3
"At full price and including the taxes, the rates seem slightly high. Best USP are the Car Parking (Though Small and on high occupancy days, you may have problems, Restaurant and Bar). Ideal location for persons having work in T Nagar / Pondy bazaar. Did all my work walking while my car was safe in the parking lot. This area is heavily congested and walking or taking an Auto is best if possible.",3
"Hotel is very good & clean. Hotel person attention is satisfactory. Hotel location is on prime area. I enjoyed & value of money, preparation of foods are good. Over all services satisfied. We can also enjoy purchases by very near market.",3
Fair facilities,2
"During last Chennai floods, the hotel provided us with hot water, electricity (using own standby generator), WiFi (for most of the period) and good food. Many hotels in the surroundings did not provide such facilities during this period.
We are thankful to the hotel and the staff.",3
Really good hotel - convenient to easily go to the shops Restaurant was very good - amazing service. Also had a spa - which was enjoyable after a long day shopping!!,3
"Good location, otherwise the hotel needs some improvement. Broken taps and unavailability of WiFi made my stay unpleasant.",1
"Looking forward to stay again, worth staying here & may be too often with family members or for a business trip. Prime locality, easy accessibility & well connected to move around and wonderful design with very good interiors and good staff and had sweet memories",3
"Stay was pleasant, room is clean and adequate Bath fittings. Service needs to be improved as no food will be served to the room apart from breakfast. Situated in prime location, close proximity to main road. Best part of location is, Thalappakatti restaurant is situated in just around the corner.",3
Location is good neat to T Nagar where all major stores are there. Also hotel rooms are small but made up good. Breakfast is OK as they are not making there instead getting from outside. Otherwise Bali for money good hotel to stay for 1-2 day.,3
"We have stayed for 4 nights. Room service, ambience and breakfast is good. Location too is in heart of the city. The only drawback is they do not have restaurant. Rest of the things are excellent and I would like to suggest this hotel to my colleagues and friends.",3
Comfortable reconditioned rooms with shower chamber. Centrally located. Breakfast is average. Taxi and auto easily available. 10 km 1/2 hour drive from airport. T nagar market with major shopping malls is nearby. Krishna sweets. More outlet and Sarvana Bhawan are also closeby at walking distance.,3
For a single person it is Very nice. Located at very good place to access nearby T-nagar. Options in breakfast are from idli sambar to a variety. Staff from security to manager are all professional & that's great. Wi-Fi is good. Keep going. Value for money.,3
"Other aspects like location, cleanliness, services was OK.. In food quality and in Restaurant menu much more improvement is needed.. I was ordering for mix veg but at 9. 30 PM itself they told that it's sold out. And then I order for outside food..",3
Well located. Staff were OK. Breakfast was having less number of items. Service was fine. Need a little more cleanliness it is worth the amount for the location Enjoyed our stay there.,3
"When I was reach the hotel by 11. 30pm with stomach, but reception guy arrange me a wonderful food over there with in 20 minutes. Allocated room was very good",3
"Except for some of the basic amenities for which they charge (like toothbrush and paste, soap). This hotel is the best at this price. The room service was wonderful. AC at it's best. Cleanliness and room fresheners were optimum. Flexible policies. Even if you want to extend the stay by 1-2 hours, they accept it.",3
Room a little congested. Location is great. Staff and especially manager very helpful. Dinning area is very congested. Very limited in room dining options. Need to improve on that. Otherwise enjoyed the stay and location.,2
Amazing experience. Very clean room. Faster wifi. Wholesome breakfast. Friendly warm staff. Centrally located. You should try. The hotel feels brand new. Will stay there again. The fold was very good. The service was prompt. Gave a chance to order food from outside.,3
The staff was very friendly and helpful even though I arrived at midnight. I was able to order room service also which was excellent as I was very hungry after travelling. The room was comfortable and very clean. The gym was always staffed with a coach which was very helpful.,3
Good budget hotel in prime location of T nagar. Although room was very small but still manageable. Should have more space for breakfast in morning as it is really very tight. Overall experience is good.,3
"Worth for money, very neat and clean. As a business person thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Nice service and staff are moving very polite. Very close to all places and nice locality. Reasonable breakfast served. Well maintained hotel.",3
Overall okay,3
It was comfortable and value for money,2
"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. The room was good and clean. Internet was a bit slow but manageable. Bit far from TNagar shopping, but Auto and Taxis are readily available. Did not have time to try the food.",3
Just OK...too small bed size,2
"there are two of these hotels, and I went to the other location first, Google maps' fault :). the place is clean well maintained and will definitely stay again. Only issue is (if it matters) it's a little far from the airport. But, early next morning (I only stayed here for a night in transit) I booked Uber for approx 300 Rupees and it took about 30 minutes to get there. it will take much more time if later in day. I left at 7:00 am.",3
"We booked a deluxe room with king bed and gave a standard room with twin beds. We said to the guy it's not my problem. I choosed that hotel only because you have a king bed. After ten minutes, gave us a junior suite with a king bed. Talk when you don't have a good room.",3
"I had to stay overnight and close to the airport. The hotel's location was convenient. Getting taxis for local travel was very easy. The staff were courteous and helpful. However, the single room had no window, hence no natural lighting. Also, the hotel is right on the main road and the noise of the traffic kept me awake as I am a light sleeper.",3
We rravelles from pondycherry to get bcr flight on nex day. So ... The hotel is very nice and OYO .. Management super and room services and its very near 2 airport ... Very low cost and auper services ... The food have 2 buy But services 24 hours so no need 2 wry and .. 2 OYO,3
It was good experience with OYO rooms in Chennai. I have been using OYO in Chennai from last 20 days and it is a good experience. We getting prices reasonable and we have not going to faar to search for any hotel. With OYO services we got rooms and rooms also which matches with the ones shown on the website. Complimentary breakfast and wifi is super in all the OYO. Sometimes we may face communication issue but overall it is a good experience.,3
very happy with the service and the room is very homely. It was a pleasant stay. I would recommend.,3
Stay was good. We felt home atmosphere. People helped us in locating the places nearby. This is a very good hotel to for a short stay. Suggestion: Lift facilities would make the stay very comfortable. Rates are very reasonable.,3
"Very helpful staff, quick to book autos and taxis, gave good advice on good places to eat out in the local area - we only stayed for one night as the location was convenient to the airport - circa 15 mins by taxi. Overall it was good experience with OYO.",3
Location of the property is excellent but the rooms may be more appealing.,2
I Have stayed here for 2 days. Prompt service being provided. Staffs are good. Only issue is the breakfast is being provided from outside. Rooms are good. Staffs are also good for guiding us routes. Overall i have enjoyed the stay. There were some issues but after highlighting those it was rectified by OYO Customer Experience.,3
I Have stayed here for 3 days. Prompt service being provided. Staff are good. Only issue is the breakfast is being provided from outside. Rooms are good. Staff are also good for guiding us routes. Overall I have enjoyed the stay. There were some issues but after highlighting those it was rectified by OYO Customer Experience.,3
I booked with OYO for 2 days and my experience with the service provided by them is quite admirable. Just they need to choose hotels along with food facility. I can rate them 6-7 out of 10.,2
"It was really very good at low price. Very good appearance and high level furnisher. Good room service. Front office is also very good. Rooms are good, similar to what is shown in the website.",3
The price is too high for the type of room I have booked. And it seems they haven't received any notification from hotels.com regarding my stay. Breakfast was below average. But the hotel staffs were very nice and courteous. Hotel doesn't worth a price of 3500.,3
"hotel was excellent,I arrived at 7.30 a.m they had me into a room by 9.00 a.m check-in was at 12.00,after 17 hours on plane this was greatly appreciated.Very enjoyable stay.Highly recommend it.",3
Comfortable,3
"The room was clean. The staff was really nice to accommodate me and get everything I wanted. 
But I think the best part of this hotel is the restaurant connected to it. 
You have to try the chicken lolipops, crispy fried lamb, Hong Kong chicken fried rice, and the best dish by far, the honey chicken. 
I would stay at this hotel again for sure.",3
"Stay was good, although I was expecting few items available without having been asked, say bathroom essentials.
 newspaper didn't come the 3rd day of stay.. while the one from same day was removed from room ( May they thought I left... ugghh... miscommunication)
Who puts tv remote under the bed while cleaning....
Best thing was free WiFi n there restaurant.. . Nice food...",3
Not good,1
we reached hotel at 0930am they allow us early check in and free upgrade due to non availability of classic room.room was well maintained and clean linen.check in smooth staff was good and polite.,3
This hotel is situated in the middle of city with clean rooms and comfortable bed. Plenty of autos available in front of hotel. Decent breakfast spread and food in the restaurant is also delicious. Staffs were helping and courteous. The only problem I found was the evening traffic in front of hotel which makes it hard to cross the roads. Overall value for money.,3
"The staff was very friendly and helpful, for printouts and directions.",3
This was my first booking experience through Expedia and the check in was hassle free and we were guaranteed a room earlier than the actual check in time. We are thoroughly happy with the friendly staff. The toilets were a bit cramped but it was very well maintained.,3
The stay was fantastic with helpful staff members and very comfort stay at chennai...,3
"Nice hotel ,friendly staff central location.nice breakfast.Good Wifi.",3
The hotel is located fairly centrally with a short drive to anywhere. ( Approx 200 INR to the airport and a similar amount to George Town.) The staff will arrange taxis and explain to driver where he is to take you in Tamil (as most we encountered only spoke Tamil ) Alternatively you can tour around for 4 hours for about 800 INR.,3
"hotel staffs and the managers are very helpfull, restaurant attached to the hotel is very convenient",3
It was value for money hotel.,3
"Been to Chennai before and stayed in other hotels. So my review is as under- Rooms are clean but the ac and in-room mini fridge was not working efficiently. Single x 2 Cots have 10\"" mattresses which make sleeping difficult as beds give a sense of instability.",2
"This hotel is located at T-Nagar. Initially, it was difficult to locate the hotel as it is situated in by lanes, but I called the hotel and asked the driver to know the exact location. Hotel is neat and clean. Everything I found to be OK. The only suggestion is that the complimentary breakfast could be better and more variety can be provided.",3
The overall experience was good and the hotel is located in the city. The appearance of the hotel was pretty attractive. The staff were very professional and courteous. The room allotted was very good and maintained clean with all essential facilities. There was no delay during sign in and sign out process. I will recommend this hotel to other travellers.,3
"Everything seemed good. Hotel staffs were helpful.
I didn't get the TV working from second day onwards. It seemed they didn't pay the subscription fee. 
The breakfast is good. Bathrooms were not exceptional, but fairly maintened. Rooms were a bit small.

very friendly and helpful staff,3
One night only was good and comfortable no complaints here,3
"Although the hotel was nice, clean and safe as well as a good location for shopping, the first night we were there we had to use our misquito net. Someone must have left the windows open at some point and the room was infested. The 2nd and 3rd nights were fine. Food at the restaurant was good however they do not cater for international guests when it came to breakfast. With that being said I would still recommend.",2
Experience was less than the high rating it receives. Staff helpfulness makes up for so much they were exceptional in their eagerness to help with anything they could.,2
"Great hotel with elegant rooms, great food, strong service and convenient location very close to Sipcot Information Technology park. My only disappointment was that there was no hot water in the sink or shower.

"We had a great stay. Hotel is new and very clean. Great amenities. Food is ok.
Excellent staff! Everyone is really nice and accommodating, Kannan (he helped me with my luggages) is worth a mention, what a great and pleasant person!
Only negative note is that I booked for one night through Expedia and I decided to extend for an extra night and the price i got offered me at the hotel was 2000 rupees more than the one showed on Expedia.",3
Would recommend for others,3
really nice,3
"The room is very good, and the service is also very good. If the buffet can provide more choice, that will be perfect.",3

Very nice hotel near SIPCOT IT park .Very convenient for people are vising TCS and other companies,3
"A very comfortable room, but lot of mosquitoes which creates a lot of disturbance...
The inroom dining menu is elaborate but the staff are not ready to take order as they clearly refuse to take any order....",2
Dirty bathroom.. Not cleaned properly. No bathroom mat.. No security in the night and mediocore breakfast. Room window knob was broken and I couldn't close the window properly. Access card didn't work late in the night and I had t go back to the lobby manager who was sleeping behind the desk.,1
Good for one night stay. Breakfast is not available with deluxe room. Cleanliness is OK. Area is very local but the access to the road is high. Street food is available near to the hotel which is good for tourists.,2
"Room Service is terribly slow. For 2 bottle of water had to wait 1hr 30 mins. Lastly, when the water came it was warm, I had asked for cold. Overall, it was not a great experience. Although, buffet breakfast was good. It's a costly hotel considering room service.",1
"Congested rooms, absolutely poor service even at the reception. Overall not worth the money and it was evident that management is negligent about their reputation. Not properly organized and made us wait for half an hour for room keys in spite of having booked in advance. Overall it was a bad experience.",1

"Happened to visit Chennai and booked a room in IRIS. The hotel is in a very congested place with poor locality. Reception itself made me upset, when I saw the room I was so disappointed that left it within 10 mins. Though the staff at reception were very courteous but rooms are pathetic.",1
Overall the stay was of great value for money. The location was perfect for my needs. I would recommend this hotel to anybody.,3
"Looking my need, the location of the hotel is idle. Tarrif is quite reasonable. Staff behavior is nice. I have recommended this hotel to my other colleagues who will visit Chennai. The only drawback I found with the hotel is that they do not have any pick & drop facilities.",3
Nonsense place recommended by make my trip fake ranking.

Very decent stay ... We stay at this hotel every holidays ... Atleast a week ... Past 4 years ... Good ambience. Good food ... Nice staff ... And really value for our money. Totally much satisfied,3
Cleanliness is awesome. Extra beds are overpriced. Staff is not willing to adjust check-in and checkout times despite telling them in the extras at the time of booking the hotel. The room service is also poor. I asked them to get 2 water bottles. They took nearly 30 mins and got only 1.,3
"Overall, a good experience. Food at Ali's grill was awesome and very good price. Breakfast and buffet at lunch was what we went for. Hats off to the quality of the food and hospitality. Room was good too, but the third bed was not very comfortable. Toilets are in a bad condition.",3

"Too small rooms. you even can't walk.
Wall to wall fitted bed.
Not value for money.",1
Communication with the staff was very difficult as they spoke minimal English. They seemed to be unaware they took bookings through Expedia so even though we had already paid they knew nothing about the booking. We almost missed our plane as although we had asked for a large taxi a small one turned up that refused to take us. The room we finally got was a good size but had cockroach's.,1

I am staying here for the second time. So convenient for T-Nagar shopping and after reaching hotel a peaceful stay as it resides in the residential area. Breakfast was home made so what ever I liked it. Rooms were clean and I got everything I want. The rooms are limited and I am fearing going forward getting rooms will be a challenge.,3

Very fairly priced. Small restaurant and kitchen needs an hour to serve in rooms. It's a clean and good place. Liked it.,3
"It was a very comfortable stay. The place seemed a bit old on the outside, but inside the rooms is a beautiful and comfortable and fresh stay. Loved the stay and would repeat this again, if I get another chance. The only snag I had was with hotel staff not being able to give things on time, when I asked, but they were courteous anyway.",3
"Ideal hotel if you are going for US visa. Great location, great homely place and excellent service. It's right behind the Chief Ministers house. Clean location. The place is very peaceful and the staff is helpful. One advice for visitors is to order food well in advance as they take about 30+ minutes to deliver.",3
It was a horrible experience. I don't know why MMT refers such filthy places. It spoils the credentials of MMT. It can be just termed as a guest house. Improved version of dormitory. Floor is with old styled tiles. Not even a carpet. AC does not work. A ceiling fan in room which makes hell lot of noise. Old styled bath room with an electric geyser In short horrible recommend MMT to remove from its list..,1
"An Old Bungalow/ House, converted into a spacious hotel. Very comfortable, spacious rooms, with clean bathrooms. A limited breakfast spread, but quite tasty food with live counters. Was here for 6 days & the staff were very friendly & courteous, WIFI- Not working for the entire duration. Toiletries, can definitely improve given the amount they charge to the customers. Overall, stay was very relaxing.",3
"Hi I used to stay there for one week, it primary location in OMR main road, cleanliness is average and more secure area to stay with family. It is reasonably OK for Manet value. Thanks for Makemytrip online portal for their reasonable concession.",3

"Except small maintenance problems, Total stay was good and Nice. Staff response is good. Affordable cost. But the need to improve the maintenance littile bit. Very near to the transport facilities.",3
"Old apartments used as hotel. Manager is not professional at all, argues harshly. Too many rules and regulation. Other good hotels are there for same price opt for them. If spending a night with roof above your head is your concern then go for it or just stay away.",1
"They don't know what hotel service is at all. Hardly any room service is there or they provide. The positive point is the location but nothing else you can expect what you can normally look for in a hotel service. But for a day's accommodation, it's ok. Not advisable for longer stays.",2
"Very poor quality food & drink, facility is worst and no room service available. Their behavior is like they are very disappointed as we come to stay at there place. This is the worst guest house I have visited ever in my life. In my opinion no one should book that guest house.",2
Rooms are good. Service is quite ok. DON'T Know if its the flood effect or not but internet through wifi always shows limited connection & the staff were not able to fix it else everything is ok.

Stay was good at this price. Location is near market. Clean....... . .... ......................................................................................................................................................................,3
"From my side this is not food to stay in this hotel with family.

Hotel rooms are not clean, charges are high that compared. 

Hotel staff has to learn lot of things. 

Hotel has to work hard on many things.",1
This is a basic Hotel. The price was a little higher for the standard of this hotel. Bathrooms were not that clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. They charged for 3 persons per room but for the third person they gave only a small mattress without the bed and expected us to put the mattress on the floor and sleep which this is very bad. when asked they said that this is the policy of the hotel.,1
"One of the worst dirty hotel, stay away from this hotel. Room blanket is spotted with yellow spots, towels are old and the worst is bathroom where you can see yellow spots. stay away from this hotel",1
"room is clean,maintenance is good,airport services is excellent.",3
good place to consider.the quality of linen looks dull.bright and spot less linen would be appreciated if maintained.the only complaint is reservation was not found on the system and this delayed the check in process.if not it could have helped us save more time,3
"Except that the place is close to Chennai airport, nothing is noteworthy. Rooms was not clean. The flush mechanism didn't work and no effort was made to repair the faulty mechanism. No elevators. Only good thing is that they provide free pick up and drop from and to Chennai airport.",2
Very closed to the airport,2
"Such a poor pick up arrangement, pathetic reception area, noisy surroundings, dirty room, no wardrobe, poor quality chair & table",1
Good considering its location but still could have been better for the price they charged. Service was good and would recommend for someone aboarding a flight.,2
Its a good experience.,3
"Rooms were never cleaned, full of mosquitoes. Worst choice in my life",1
Rooms are not clean. I think they never clean the bathrooms and bedsheets also. Room service is horrible we need to wait for at least 30 min for any kind of service.,1
"It is on a good location and the staff are courteous. I checked in early as i had to check out early, but they charged me an extra 500 rs. Also, in the room, blankets and pillows had foul smell and toilet jet was not working.",2
"Receiving of reception and clarity of info delivered is not proper. Rooms are upto the mark. Need to improve the appearance from outside. It is not good, may be due to old construction. Other than that everything is fine. Food delivered is upto the mark.",2
"Bathrooms were not good, though bearable. Der was no lock in bathroom then we waited while they adusted the lock and flush and shower was not working and their was a hint of foul smell too",2
I stayed in the hotel for a client meet and the experience was really wonderful. I don't think I really cared about the amenities other than the basic ones. The rooms were quite nice. The mattresses in the rooms were the nest a hotel can have. This was the best hotel I have ever visited. You will get a complimentary breakfast for sure. Which is a good one.,3
"Service is good and it is easy to locate. Food is okay and other amenities, provided are just okay. As there aint much better options in this area, at reasonable price. So its better to stay in Oyo. Which provides quality rooms at a reasonable prices.",2
The experience was fantastic..the service of front office stuff is awesome. The room service was fantastic...the management was not at all worried about the payments ..instead they were concern about the well being of their guests...we have been to India especially Chennai several times and never experienced such a great service....starting from cleanliness all major aspects were perfect.,1
"I had a good time at the hotel, I would certainly recommend for others. I would suggest to book this hotel through yaatra for a reasonable price. If you have not come to Chennai for leisure stay, go for it. So guys go for it if you are on official purpose!!",2
I stayed there for 4 days. It is a good hotel. Staff behaviour was very good there. There was no delay in check in and check out procedure. Room was okay with all amenities. They all were in working condition. Food was good. All facilities were good there. No activity was there. They should have been added activities in this hotel. I travelled there single in November 2013 for roam around and for work.,3
"The location is close to the bus stand and it is within the city. The rooms are of AC and the service is excellent, the room was booked in advance. Food is good and bar facility is available. Parking space is available. Wifi is available and it is recommendable hotel to others.",3
"It was 5 days stay at Thulasi Park Hotel, it was situated at main city and there were basic facilities in the room and also spacious, food was tasty with lot of variety, we weren't used the activities organised in the hotel, there were enough space for parking. Overall we enjoyed the stay and all in all.",3
That hotel was very nice but water was very salted i got a allergic problem in using that water food and all also not bad room boy and everything is not nice near kodambakkam it is famous area of chennai all actors is here only my girl friend also happy a/c room is good only,3
"The Staff at front office and F&B were extremely gracious, their friendliness and hospilaity made me feel as if I was at home.",3
Solid option close to the airport. Not all restaurants open. Accommodating staff.,3
"Our stay at zone was pretty good. Staff were super amazing all the way from front desk reception staff (who even helped negotiate the rickshaw scooter rate for us) to the staff at the restaurant. Amazing people. 
I wished they would take more care of the mosquito issue though. Too many in the building.",3
The service was so good that it was a little bit overbearing at times.,3
It was great to stay at Zone....,3
A good place for comfortable stay.,3
"Hotel Gokulam Park, Chennai - Very good location, nice room, good & courteous staff and service, Front Desk very help full. Everything about the hotel is fantastic except that in bathroom & tea kettle I found small type cockroach which raised health concerns.",3
The rooms looks like a old and very small poorly maintained. Because we found couple of bed bugs... Air conditioners are very old and it stopped working and making sounds frequently suddenly. Swiping not working while opening door. Restaurant food or not good average and server are also not enough knowledge.,3
The rooms appeared to be very old and poorly maintained. Air conditioners are very old and it stopped working intermittently. Furnitures were shabby. Location was okay. The room size was very small. Bathrooms were not really neat and clean.,2
"A budget hotel in nice location ( Ashok Nagar, Chennai), good staff and breakfast at rooftop restaurant is served fresh and good quality food. Location of Hotel is also at key location and convenient for all, The rooms were well maintained, Best value for money ..",3
"Basic room and facilities. Decent food and breakfast options. Good for short business trips. Room service is a bit slow, need to follow up to get your food. Convenient if your business is around the location.",3
"Please ignore this. They are do many options in this city. Poor service, poor maintenance, no TV channels, no response on your requests. Absolute waste of money. Just for location close to airport and very easily located... Nothing else I mean..",1
"I visited Chennai in the month of September 2015 and stayed in this hotel. It was convenient to locate the hotel and it was in centre of the city. There was no delay in check in and checkout. The room allotted to me was spacious and it was well maintained with all required amenities in working condition. Overall, I was satisfied with the stay.",3
Hotel is good. Well-maintained and correct value of money. Service was also good. Rooms were small and comfortable. Trip was wonderful and memorable. Hotel also help with travel facilities which made it more convenient.,3
"This is kind of good budget hotel for people who doesn't want to afford 3 stars. Considering to pricing services, cleanliness are satisfactory. Quality of the food served, food menu and prices are is good. Room service is well enough to satisfy the customer.",3
All services are excellent and staff also helpful. Mr Khan is very important and interesting to know how to manage in Chennai. So I will always support and stay in Hotel Golulam Park.,3
You can't get more than the available facility for the money we pay. Awesome. Breakfast spread is ordinary but tasty. Sound proof glass required as we can hear honking noise clearly since the location of hotel is on the main road.,3
"Extremely satisfied with the service and the quality of the room. Food was good, location is very good so it's a very good deal. Car parking is not adequate and that is the only problem other wise it's value for money.",3
Well I asked these guys for a booking over the counter and the price they told me was nearly double that of Makemytrip! Place is clean and decent. Staff are ok (they were creating unnecessary problem during check-out). Food is ok too.,3
"I had to do a short stay along with my wife in Chennai for some personal work. Gokulam park is a wonderful choice for it - given the location, staff courtesy, south Indian food, room amenities, etc. Rooms could have dark curtains. I would recommend this hotel for this price than other hotels nearby.",3
Nice to stay with their.......................... .. .... ...,3
"Located in the heart of the Kashmir Valley, which is called 'Paradise on Earth', Srinagarâ€™s landscape is interspersed with greenery, lakes and hillocks. The city is spread out along the banks of the Jhelum River and is famous for its surrounding natural beauty and postcard tourist spots. The two parts of the city are connected by nine bridges. The Hari Parbat and the Shankar Acharya hills lie on either side of the city.",3
"I stayed for three days, got good response but the food din't go well. As my taste was fully bombayish.. The hotel doesnt provide buffet spread, but was very satisified with the south indian breakfast, a different taste, but very less.. Sabse bada pet lekhin kam khaana, alag pura bahoth acha sa prop. Pura satisfied ho, In pondi bazar, had good entertainment, luv chennai!! Thankz for the gift!!",3
Room was clean and comfortable.,3
Not worth for the money paid. Toilet commode and pipe fittings need immediate replacement.Toilet flooring and wall pianting need to be improvised. Bed matress is really good . Wish to see a better breakfast menu.,2
Not bad,2
Nothing much,3
No very good hotel,1
very arrogant and unpleasing receptionist unfit to hold a post in hospitality. Shouting against a guest in a hotel charging 3700/ per day is unheard in the annals of hotel industry. I never forget the humiliation met with and really want to make a serious complaint but to whom? .,1
"I do not want to trust this website,I booked a hotel and after going hotel they told rooms are not avaliable.They told they will refund the money which they didnt do.I called after few days and spoke to customer service they said they have to it manually and its a technical prob ..its like wasting of my time calling customer care again and again",1
Ok,2
Food is very expensive,1
The service staff should be more customer centric and the bath space is too small to even stand and take bath.,1
"The room is small. Bathroom is too small. It is not very clean. Accessibility to the hotel is not very good. It is in side road. A/c was not working. Breakfast is served in the room and you have to eat in the bed (:- you have to give the car keys to the security as the car is parked outside, check out is 24hrs from the check in time.",1
"Staff are really helpful, they treat you with great hospitality. Cleanliness in the premises which make your stay more comfortable. Convenient location. Definitely value for money.",3
"The room was very nice, although, the bed was stiff as a board. That actually worked out well, I slept very well. The breakfast room is very small, but that gave me the opportunity to share conversation with a stranger. The breakfast buffet was limited, but really delicious and fresh, high quality items were served.",3
it was good for short stay..,2
"I originally booked a room for one person; then I corrected the booking for two persons with two beds. They said they did not receive the second, corrected request. Promised a room with two beds, but manage, Mr. Anand, initially reneged in an unpleasant way. ok resolved. Noisy clientel; quality of breakfast not high.",1
Staff were not friendly - the room we booked was in anouther building- beds were worst I've ever slept in- breakfast was minimal-,1
Wifi is practically non existent,2
"This hotel is best for shopping, balaji temple, different food joints. Etc. Chennai famous pondy bazaar is 2 min walk away. Staff is very good. Rooms are big size. Good choice in breakfast which is free.",3
"I called room service to collect my laundry. One person came and without even knocking, he unlocked the door with their master key. Chain was hooked or else he could have entered the room directly. Rooms in hotel are meant to be private but here its not. Don't know with how many people they have done this and apologized. Good luck for your visit.",3
I suggest to everyone never ever go here. The pics of good hotel and good rooms but gave room in a guest house rooms like servant quarter very bad staff. They fights with a customers. Never ever go to this hotel.,1
Different treatment for online makemytrip booking and direct hotel on site booking. Particularly on check run-out times. On line 12-12pm and for direct 24 hours. Most international flights lands at early morning. Then this 12pm in and outs are troubling for onward flight travels in the same day evenings. Local bookings are saved from this situation.,3
"Good hotel located very near to T. Nagar main shopping area, rooms are neatly maintained. Staff are good and polite. Service is good. Food is good. Definitely value for money hotel. Especially, for stay with family.",3
The hotel staff is very cooperative and excellent in service. We requested for spiceless food for our older parents and they obliged and prepared the same. The executive rooms are spacious and very clean. It was great value for money with makemytrip discount.,3
Very good location and comfortable rooms. Courteous staff and good complimentary south indian breakfast served. Welcomed well and accepted for little extra hours of stay. Limited as well as unlimited variety of food available for lunch and dinner.,3
"Excellent location in central T. Maharashtra, great accommodation and facilities at right price. Good quality breakfast and good restaurant. Great to have a WiFi facility. People are courteous and helpful.",3
Ek dum horrible hai hotel Kabi be yaha koi na jaye photo kuch dhikhaya hai jaa k Ganda sa room dete hai full of gande room Gandhi service or Ganda sa Khana I suggest to every one its a fake pics or fake every everything. Please never ever go here in life,3
Very bad staff ugly hotel he shown me a good pics in here but given me a bad room full of mosquitoes smelly very bad staff very bad food quality he shown the pics of hotel on road but given the room in back side cottage ugly rooms never ever go to here again,3
Hotel is not interested to a lot rooms to those who comes through online. Check in time delayed more than 6 hrs. Asking us to wait in lobby. Next day getting call and asking when we vacating the room before 24hrs.,2
Hotel is close to the T Nagar shopping area. Our objective of value for money was achieved- both in the shopping and the hotel charges. We got an upgrade without asking. Recommended for families.,3
"Better & cheap good facility. It has good staff, food facility",3
The location and service personnels were awesome. The rooms were clean and tidy. Only thing was we were provided rooms in an adjacent building and not on the main one. Hope it ll be wiped out next time.,3
"Stay were pleasing and courteous. When booked online it is a 1 pm 12pm checkout. There is hot water facility and restaurant available at the ground floor high serves good quality food, though it is slightly on the expensive side. Overall it's a good package.",3
"Bath room had leaks, decorative condition of bathroom
Poor. Staff are very helpful.",2
Overall it was ok. Walkable distance for shopping in TNAGAR. Easy access to airport & Railway station. Non-smoking rooms.,2
Its was awesome place to stay.,3
Nice place for business travellers.. Very friendly staff,3
Nice at residential place,2
"spacious enough.
